(a)  (1)  A party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding \nif it is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action \nor proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since \nthe general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom the \nmotion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that the court, \nwith or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct. \n(2)  Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties \nto the action at least 81 days before the time appointed for hearing. If the notice is \nserved by mail, the required 81-day period of notice shall be increased by 5 days if \nthe place of address is within the State of California, 10 days if the place of address \nis outside the State of California but within the United States, and 20 days if the place \nof address is outside the United States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission, \nexpress mail, or another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the \nrequired 81-day period of notice shall be increased by two court days. \n(3)  The motion shall be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless \nthe court for good cause orders otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not extend \nthe time within which a party must otherwise file a responsive pleading. \n(4)  A party shall not bring more than one motion for summary judgment against \nan adverse party to the action or proceeding. This limitation does not apply to motions \nfor summary adjudication. \n(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on motion or application \nof any party and a showing of good cause, the court may grant leave for the moving \nparty to bring an additional motion for summary judgment. The moving party shall \nserve the notice and supporting papers for any such additional motion in accordance \nwith paragraph (2) of subdivision (a). \n(b)  (1)  The motion shall be supported by affidavits, declarations, admissions, \nanswers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice shall or \nmay be taken. The supporting papers shall include a separate statement setting forth \nplainly and concisely all material facts that the moving party contends are undisputed. \nEach of the material facts stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting \nevidence. The failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in \nthe court’s discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the motion. \n(2)  An opposition to the motion shall be served and filed not less than 20 days \npreceding the noticed or continued date of hearing, unless the court for good cause \norders otherwise. The opposition, where appropriate, shall consist of affidavits, \nSTATE OF CALIFORNIA\nAUTHENTICATED \nELECTRONIC LEGAL MATERIAL\n\ndeclarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which \njudicial notice shall or may be taken. \n(3)  The opposition papers shall include a separate statement that responds to each \nof the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed, indicating if \nthe opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed. The statement \nalso shall set forth plainly and concisely any other material facts the opposing party \ncontends are disputed. Each material fact contended by the opposing party to be \ndisputed shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. Failure to comply \nwith this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a sufficient ground, in \nthe court’s discretion, for granting the motion. \n(4)  A reply to the opposition shall be served and filed by the moving party not less \nthan 11 days preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing, unless the court for \ngood cause orders otherwise. The reply shall not include any new evidentiary matter, \nadditional material facts, or separate statement submitted with the reply and not \npresented in the moving papers or opposing papers. \n(5)  Evidentiary objections not made at the hearing shall be deemed waived. \n(6)  Except for subdivision (c) of Section 1005 relating to the method of service of \nopposition and reply papers, Sections 1005 and 1013, extending the time within which \na right may be exercised or an act may be done, do not apply to this section. \n(7)  An incorporation by reference of a matter in the court’s file shall set forth with \nspecificity the exact matter to which reference is being made and shall not incorporate \nthe entire file. \n(c)  The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted \nshow that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In determining if the papers show that there \nis no triable issue as to any material fact, the court shall consider all of the evidence \nset forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have been made and \nsustained by the court, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, \nexcept summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences \nreasonably deducible from the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or evidence \nthat raise a triable issue as to any material fact. \n(d)  Supporting and opposing affidavits or declarations shall be made by a person \non personal knowledge, shall set forth admissible evidence, and shall show \naffirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavits \nor declarations. An objection based on the failure to comply with the requirements \nof this subdivision, if not made at the hearing, shall be deemed waived. \n(e)  If a party is otherwise entitled to summary judgment pursuant to this section, \nsummary judgment shall not be denied on grounds of credibility or for want of \ncross-examination of witnesses furnishing affidavits or declarations in support of the \nsummary judgment, except that summary judgment may be denied in the discretion \nof the court if the only proof of a material fact offered in support of the summary \njudgment is an affidavit or declaration made by an individual who was the sole witness \nto that fact; or if a material fact is an individual’s state of mind, or lack thereof, and \nthat fact is sought to be established solely by the individual’s affirmation thereof. \n\n(f)  (1)  A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of \naction within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one or more claims for \ndamages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party contends that the cause of action \nhas no merit, that there is no affirmative defense to the cause of action, that there is \nno merit to an affirmative defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to \na claim for damages, as specified in Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or \nmore defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs. A \nmotion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a \ncause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty. \n(2)  A motion for summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an alternative \nto a motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all procedural respects as a \nmotion for summary judgment. A party shall not move for summary judgment based \non issues asserted in a prior motion for summary adjudication and denied by the court \nunless that party establishes, to the satisfaction of the court, newly discovered facts \nor circumstances or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the summary \njudgment motion. \n(g)  Upon the denial of a motion for summary judgment on the ground that there \nis a triable issue as to one or more material facts, the court shall, by written or oral \norder, specify one or more material facts raised by the motion that the court has \ndetermined there exists a triable controversy. This determination shall specifically \nrefer to the evidence proffered in support of and in opposition to the motion that \nindicates that a triable controversy exists. Upon the grant of a motion for summary \njudgment on the ground that there is no triable issue of material fact, the court shall, \nby written or oral order, specify the reasons for its determination. The order shall \nspecifically refer to the evidence proffered in support of and, if applicable, in \nopposition to the motion that indicates no triable issue exists. The court shall also \nstate its reasons for any other determination. The court shall record its determination \nby court reporter or written order. \n(h)  If it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary \njudgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify opposition \nmay exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court shall deny the motion, \norder a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had, or make \nany other order as may be just. The application to continue the motion to obtain \nnecessary discovery may also be made by ex parte motion at any time on or before \nthe date the opposition response to the motion is due. \n(i)  If, after granting a continuance to allow specified additional discovery, the court \ndetermines that the party seeking summary judgment has unreasonably failed to allow \nthe discovery to be conducted, the court shall grant a continuance to permit the \ndiscovery to go forward or deny the motion for summary judgment or summary \nadjudication. This section does not affect or limit the ability of a party to compel \ndiscovery under the Civil Discovery Act (Title 4 (commencing with Section 2016.010) \nof Part 4). \n(j)  If the court determines at any time that an affidavit was presented in bad faith \nor solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall order the party who presented the \n\naffidavit to pay the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses the filing of \nthe affidavit caused the other party to incur. Sanctions shall not be imposed pursuant \nto this subdivision except on notice contained in a party’s papers or on the court’s \nown noticed motion, and after an opportunity to be heard. \n(k)  Unless a separate judgment may properly be awarded in the action, a final \njudgment shall not be entered on a motion for summary judgment before the \ntermination of the action, but the final judgment shall, in addition to any matters \ndetermined in the action, award judgment as established by the summary proceeding \nprovided for in this section. \n(l)  In an action arising out of an injury to the person or to property, if a motion for \nsummary judgment is granted on the basis that the defendant was without fault, no \nother defendant during trial, over plaintiff’s objection, may attempt to attribute fault \nto, or comment on, the absence or involvement of the defendant who was granted the \nmotion. \n(m)  (1)  A summary judgment entered under this section is an appealable judgment \nas in other cases. Upon entry of an order pursuant to this section, except the entry of \nsummary judgment, a party may, within 20 days after service upon the party of a \nwritten notice of entry of the order, petition an appropriate reviewing court for a \nperemptory writ. If the notice is served by mail, the initial period within which to file \nthe petition shall be increased by five days if the place of address is within the State \nof California, 10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but \nwithin the United States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United \nStates. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or another \nmethod of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the initial period within which \nto file the petition shall be increased by two court days. The superior court may, for \ngood cause, and before the expiration of the initial period, extend the time for one \nadditional period not to exceed 10 days. \n(2)  Before a reviewing court affirms an order granting summary judgment or \nsummary adjudication on a ground not relied upon by the trial court, the reviewing \ncourt shall afford the parties an opportunity to present their views on the issue by \nsubmitting supplemental briefs. The supplemental briefs may include an argument \nthat additional evidence relating to that ground exists, but the party has not had an \nadequate opportunity to present the evidence or to conduct discovery on the issue. \nThe court may reverse or remand based upon the supplemental briefs to allow the \nparties to present additional evidence or to conduct discovery on the issue. If the court \nfails to allow supplemental briefs, a rehearing shall be ordered upon timely petition \nof a party. \n(n)  (1)  If a motion for summary adjudication is granted, at the trial of the action, \nthe cause or causes of action within the action, affirmative defense or defenses, claim \nfor damages, or issue or issues of duty as to the motion that has been granted shall be \ndeemed to be established and the action shall proceed as to the cause or causes of \naction, affirmative defense or defenses, claim for damages, or issue or issues of duty \nremaining. \n\n(2)  In the trial of the action, the fact that a motion for summary adjudication is \ngranted as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses, claims for damages, \nor issues of duty within the action shall not bar any cause of action, affirmative defense, \nclaim for damages, or issue of duty as to which summary adjudication was either not \nsought or denied. \n(3)  In the trial of an action, neither a party, a witness, nor the court shall comment \nto a jury upon the grant or denial of a motion for summary adjudication. \n(o)  A cause of action has no merit if either of the following exists: \n(1)  One or more of the elements of the cause of action cannot be separately \nestablished, even if that element is separately pleaded. \n(2)  A defendant establishes an affirmative defense to that cause of action. \n(p)  For purposes of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication: \n(1)  A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that party’s burden of showing that \nthere is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the \ncause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once the plaintiff \nor cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant or \ncross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to \nthe cause of action or a defense thereto. The defendant or cross-defendant shall not \nrely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of \nmaterial fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable \nissue of material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto. \n(2)  A defendant or cross-defendant has met that party’s burden of showing that a \ncause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the \ncause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is \na complete defense to the cause of action. Once the defendant or cross-defendant has \nmet that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff or cross-complainant to show that \na triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense \nthereto. The plaintiff or cross-complainant shall not rely upon the allegations or denials \nof its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall \nset forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the \ncause of action or a defense thereto. \n(q)  In granting or denying a motion for summary judgment or summary \nadjudication, the court need rule only on those objections to evidence that it deems \nmaterial to its disposition of the motion. Objections to evidence that are not ruled on \nfor purposes of the motion shall be preserved for appellate review. \n(r)  This section does not extend the period for trial provided by Section 1170.5. \n(s)  Subdivisions (a) and (b) do not apply to actions brought pursuant to Chapter 4 \n(commencing with Section 1159) of Title 3 of Part 3. \n(t)  Notwithstanding subdivision (f), a party may move for summary adjudication \nof a legal issue or a claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not \ncompletely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of duty pursuant \nto this subdivision. \n\n(1)  (A)  Before filing a motion pursuant to this subdivision, the parties whose \nclaims or defenses are put at issue by the motion shall submit to the court both of the \nfollowing: \n(i)  A joint stipulation stating the issue or issues to be adjudicated. \n(ii)  A declaration from each stipulating party that the motion will further the interest \nof judicial economy by decreasing trial time or significantly increasing the likelihood \nof settlement. \n(B)  The joint stipulation shall be served on any party to the civil action who is not \nalso a party to the motion. \n(2)  Within 15 days of receipt of the stipulation and declarations, unless the court \nhas good cause for extending the time, the court shall notify the stipulating parties if \nthe motion may be filed. In making this determination, the court may consider \nobjections by a nonstipulating party made within 10 days of the submission of the \nstipulation and declarations. \n(3)  If the court elects not to allow the filing of the motion, the stipulating parties \nmay request, and upon request the court shall conduct, an informal conference with \nthe stipulating parties to permit further evaluation of the proposed stipulation. The \nstipulating parties shall not file additional papers in support of the motion. \n(4)  (A)  A motion for summary adjudication made pursuant to this subdivision \nshall contain a statement in the notice of motion that reads substantially similar to the \nfollowing: “This motion is made pursuant to subdivision (t) of Section 437c of the \nCode of Civil Procedure. The parties to this motion stipulate that the court shall hear \nthis motion and that the resolution of this motion will further the interest of judicial \neconomy by decreasing trial time or significantly increasing the likelihood of \nsettlement.” \n(B)  The notice of motion shall be signed by counsel for all parties, and by those \nparties in propria persona, to the motion. \n(5)  A motion filed pursuant to this subdivision may be made by itself or as an \nalternative to a motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all procedural \nrespects as a motion for summary judgment. \n(u)  For purposes of this section, a change in law does not include a later enacted \nstatute without retroactive application. \n(Amended by Stats. 2024, Ch. 99, Sec. 1.
