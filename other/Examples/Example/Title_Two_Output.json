Although this rule exempts self-represented parties from any mandatory electronic \nfiling and service requirements, these parties are encouraged to participate voluntarily in electronic filing \nand service.

At the same \ntime, it seeks to protect legitimate privacy concerns. \n \n51 \n \nSubdivision (c). This subdivision excludes certain records (those other than the register, calendar, and \nindexes) in specified types of cases (notably criminal, juvenile, and family court matters) from public \nremote access. The committee recognized that while these case records are public records and should \nremain available at the courthouse, either in paper or electronic form, they often contain sensitive \npersonal information. The court should not publish that information over the Internet. However, the \ncommittee also recognized that the use of the Internet may be appropriate in certain criminal cases of \nextraordinary public interest where information regarding a case will be widely disseminated through the \nmedia. In such cases, posting of selected nonconfidential court records, redacted where necessary to \nprotect the privacy of the participants, may provide more timely and accurate information regarding the \ncourt proceedings, and may relieve substantial burdens on court staff in responding to individual requests \nfor documents and information. Thus, under subdivision (e), if the presiding judge makes individualized \ndeterminations in a specific case, certain records in criminal cases may be made available over the \nInternet. \n \nSubdivisions (f) and (g). These subdivisions limit electronic access to records (other than the register, \ncalendars, or indexes) to a case-by-case basis and prohibit bulk distribution of those records. These \nlimitations are based on the qualitative difference between obtaining information from a specific case file \nand obtaining bulk information that may be manipulated to compile personal information culled from any \ndocument, paper, or exhibit filed in a lawsuit. This type of aggregate information may be exploited for \ncommercial or other purposes unrelated to the operations of the courts, at the expense of privacy rights of \nindividuals. \n \nCourts must send a copy of the order permitting remote access in extraordinary criminal cases to Criminal \nJustice Services, Judicial Council of California, 455 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94102-\n3688.",

Rather, the article 3 rules allow broader remote access\u2014by parties, parties\u2019 designees, parties\u2019 \nattorneys, authorized persons working in legal organizations, authorized persons working in a qualified \nlegal services project providing brief services, and court-appointed persons\u2014to those electronic records \nwhere remote access by the public is not allowed. \n \nUnder the rules in article 3, a party, a party\u2019s attorney, an authorized person working in the same legal \norganization as a party\u2019s attorney, or a person appointed by the court in the proceeding basically has the \nsame level of access to electronic records remotely that he or she would have if he or she were to seek to \ninspect the records in person at the courthouse. Thus, if he or she is legally entitled to inspect certain \nrecords at the courthouse, that person could view the same records remotely; on the other hand, if he or \nshe is restricted from inspecting certain court records at the courthouse (e.g., because the records are \nconfidential or sealed), that person would not be permitted to view the records remotely. In some types of \ncases, such as unlimited civil cases, the access available to parties and their attorneys is generally similar \nto the public\u2019s but in other types of cases, such as juvenile cases, it is much more extensive (see Cal. \nRules of Court, rule 5.552). \n \nFor authorized persons working in a qualified legal services program, the rule contemplates services \noffered in high-volume environments on an ad hoc basis. There are some limitations on access under the \nrule for qualified legal services projects. When an attorney at a qualified legal services project becomes a \nparty\u2019s attorney and offers services beyond the scope contemplated under this rule, the access rules for a \nparty\u2019s attorney would apply.",

The standard is based on NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 \nCal.4th 1178. These rules apply to civil and criminal cases. They recognize the First Amendment right of \naccess to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication. The rules do not apply to records that \ncourts must keep confidential by law. Examples of confidential records to which public access is \nrestricted by law are records of the family conciliation court (Family Code, \u00a7 1818(b)), in forma pauperis \napplications (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.54 and 8.26), and search warrant affidavits sealed under People \nv. Hobbs (1994) 7 Cal.4th 948. The sealed records rules also do not apply to discovery proceedings, \nmotions, and materials that are not used at trial or submitted to the court as a basis for adjudication. (See \nNBC Subsidiary, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 1208\u20131209, fn. 25.) \n \nRule 2.550(d)\u2013(e) is derived from NBC Subsidiary. That decision contains the requirements that the court, \nbefore closing a hearing or sealing a transcript, must find an \u201coverriding interest\u201d that supports the closure \nor sealing, and must make certain express findings. (Id. at pp. 1217\u20131218.) The decision notes that the \nFirst Amendment right of access applies to records filed in both civil and criminal cases as a basis for \nadjudication. (Id. at pp. 1208\u20131209, fn. 25.) Thus, the NBC Subsidiary test applies to the sealing of \nrecords. \n \nNBC Subsidiary provides examples of various interests that courts have acknowledged may constitute \n\u201coverriding interests.\u201d (See id. at p. 1222, fn. 46.) Courts have found that, under appropriate \ncircumstances, various statutory privileges, trade secrets, and privacy interests, when properly asserted \nand not waived, may constitute \u201coverriding interests.\u201d The rules do not attempt to define what may \nconstitute an \u201coverriding interest,\u201d but leave this to case law.",

The rules on felony, misdemeanor, and infraction appeals require that any transcript provided by a \nparty under this rule be included in the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal (see rules 8.320, 8.861, and 8.912). In \ncivil appeals, the parties may designate such a transcript for inclusion in the clerk\u2019s transcript (see rules \n8.122(b) and 8.832(a)). The transcripts required under this rule may also assist the court or jurors during \nthe trial court proceedings. For this purpose, it may be helpful for the trial court to request that the party \noffering an electronic recording provide additional copies of such transcripts for jurors to follow while the \nrecording is played. \n \nSubdivision (a). Note that, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.510(g), if the testimony at a \ndeposition is recorded both stenographically and by audio or video technology, the stenographic transcript \nis the official record of that testimony for the purpose of the trial and any subsequent hearing or appeal. \n \nSubdivision (a)(2). The party offering or presenting the electronic recording may serve and file a copy of \nthe cover and of the relevant pages of the deposition or other transcript; a new transcript need not be \nprepared. \n \nSubdivision (b). Note that, with the exception of recordings covered by Code of Civil Procedure section \n2025.510(g), the recording itself, not the transcript, is the evidence that was offered or presented (see \nPeople v. Sims (1993) 5 Cal.4th 405, 448). Sometimes, a party may present or offer into evidence only a \nportion of a longer electronic recording. In such circumstances, the transcript provided to the court and \nopposing parties should contain only a transcription of those portions of the electronic recording that are \nactually presented or offered into evidence. If a party believes that a transcript provided under this \nsubdivision is inaccurate, the party can raise an objection in the trial court. \n \nSubdivision (b)(3)(C). Good cause to waive the requirement for a transcript may include such factors as",
