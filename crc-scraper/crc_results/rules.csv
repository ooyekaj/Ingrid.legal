8.74,"Format of electronic documents  (a) Formatting requirements applicable to all electronic documents  (1)   Text-searchable portable document format : Electronic documents must be in text-searchable portable document format (PDF) while maintaining the original document formatting. In the limited circumstances in which a document cannot practicably be converted to a text-searchable PDF, the document may be scanned or converted to non-text- searchable PDF. An electronic filer is not required to use a specific vendor, technology, or software for creation of a searchable-format document, unless the electronic filer agrees to such use. The software for creating and reading electronic documents must be in the public domain or generally available at a reasonable cost. The printing of an electronic document must not result in the loss of document text, formatting, or appearance. The electronic filer is responsible for ensuring that any document filed is complete and readable. (2)   Pagination : The electronic page counter for the electronic document must match the page number for each page of the document. The page numbering of a document filed electronically must begin with the first page or cover page as page 1 and thereafter be paginated consecutively using only arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3). The page number for the cover page may be suppressed and need not appear on the cover page. When a document is filed in both paper form and electronic form, the pagination in both versions must comply with this paragraph. (3)   Bookmarking : An electronic bookmark is a descriptive text link that appears in the bookmarks panel of an electronic document. Each electronic document must include an electronic bookmark to each heading, subheading, and the first page of any component of the document, including any table of contents, table of authorities, petition, verification, memorandum, declaration, certificate of word count, certificate of interested entities or persons, proof of service, exhibit, or attachment. Each electronic bookmark must briefly describe the item to which it is linked. For example, an electronic bookmark to a heading must provide the text of the heading, and an electronic bookmark to an exhibit or attachment must include the letter or number of the exhibit or attachment and a brief description of the exhibit or attachment. An electronic appendix must have bookmarks to the indexes and to the first page of each separate exhibit or attachment. Exhibits or attachments within an exhibit or attachment must be bookmarked. All bookmarks must be set to retain the reader's selected zoom setting. (4)   Protection of sensitive information : Electronic filers must comply with rules 1.201, 8.45, 8.46, 8.47, and 8.401 regarding the protection of sensitive information, except for those requirements exclusively applicable to paper form. (5)   Size and multiple files : An electronic filing may not be larger than 25 megabytes. This rule does not change the limitations on word count or number of pages otherwise established by the California Rules of Court for documents filed in the court. Although certain provisions in the California Rules of Court require volumes of no more than 300 pages (see, e.g., rules 8.124(d)(1), 8.144(b)(6), 8.144(g)), an electronic filing may exceed 300 pages so long as its individual components comply with the 300-page volume requirement and the electronic filing does not exceed 25 megabytes. If a document exceeds the 25-megabyte file-size limitation, the electronic filer must submit the document in more than one file, with each file 25 megabytes or less. The first file must include a master chronological and alphabetical index stating the contents for all files. Each file must have a cover page stating (a) the file number for that file and the total number of files for that document, (b) the volumes contained in that file, and (c) the page numbers contained in that file. (For example: File 2 of 4, Volumes 3-4, pp. 301-499.) In addition, each file must be paginated consecutively across all files in the document, including the cover pages for each file. (For example, if the first file ends on page 300, the cover of the second file must be page 301.) If a multiple-file document is submitted to the court in both electronic form and paper form, the cover pages for each file must be included in the paper documents. (6)   Manual Filing : (A) When an electronic filer seeks to file an electronic document consisting of more than 10 files, or when the document cannot or should not be electronically filed in multiple files, or when electronically filing the document  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",,,13294,
2.259,"Actions by court on receipt of electronic filing  (a) Confirmation of receipt and filing of document  (1)   Confirmation of receipt  When a court receives an electronically submitted document, the court must promptly send the electronic filer confirmation of the court's receipt of the document, indicating the date and time of receipt. A document is considered received at the date and time the confirmation of receipt is created. (2)   Confirmation of filing  If the document received by the court under (1) complies with filing requirements and all required filing fees have been paid, the court must promptly send the electronic filer confirmation that the document has been filed. The filing confirmation must indicate the date and time of filing and is proof that the document was filed on the date and at the time specified.

(3)   Transmission of confirmations  The court must send receipt and filing confirmation to the electronic filer at the electronic service address the filer furnished to the court under rule 2.256(a)(4). The court must maintain a record of all receipt and filing confirmations. (4)   Filer responsible for verification  In the absence of the court's confirmation of receipt and filing, there is no presumption that the court received and filed the document. The electronic filer is responsible for verifying that the court received and filed any document that the electronic filer submitted to the court electronically.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2011; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2008.)  (b) Notice of rejection of document for filing  If the clerk does not file a document because it does not comply with applicable filing requirements or because the required filing fee has not been paid, the court must promptly send notice of the rejection of the document for filing to the electronic filer. The notice must state the reasons that the document was rejected for filing.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Delayed delivery  If a technical problem with a court's electronic filing system prevents the court from accepting an electronic filing on a particular court day, and the electronic filer demonstrates that he or she attempted to electronically file the document on that day, the court must deem the document as filed on that day. This subdivision does not apply to the filing of a complaint or any other initial pleading in an action or proceeding.  (Subd (c) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2018; adopted as subd (d); previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Endorsement  (1) The court's endorsement of a document electronically filed must contain the following: ""Electronically filed by Superior Court of California, County of ________, on _____ (date),"" followed by the name of the court clerk. (2) The endorsement required under (1) has the same force and effect as a manually affixed endorsement stamp with the signature and initials of the court clerk.

(2) After receiving the proposal, the reviewing court must order a briefing sequence and prescribe briefing periods consistent with rule 8.212(a). (3) Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Contents of briefs  (1) A party that is both an appellant and a respondent must combine its respondent's brief with its appellant's opening brief or its reply brief, if any, whichever is appropriate under the briefing sequence that the reviewing court orders. (2) A combined brief must address the points raised in each appeal separately but may include a single summary of the significant facts. (3) A party must confine a reply brief, or the reply portion of a combined brief, to points raised in its appeal.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2009; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 8.216 applies, first, to all cases in which opposing parties both appeal from the judgment. In addition, it applies to all cases in which one party appeals from the judgment and another party appeals from any appealable order arising from or related to the judgment, i.e., not only orders contemplated by rule 8.108 (denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict) but also, for example, posttrial orders granting or denying attorney fees. The purpose of the rule is to provide, in all such appeals, a single unified procedure for resolving uncertainties as to the order in which the parties must file their briefs. As used in this rule, ""appellant"" includes cross-appellant and ""respondent"" includes cross-respondent. (Compare rule 8.100(e).)  Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a) implements the above-stated purpose by providing a procedure for determining both the briefing  sequence -i.e., the order in which the parties must file their briefs-and the briefing   periods -i.e., the periods of time (e.g., 30 days or 70 days, etc.) within which the briefs must be filed. Subdivision (a)(1) places the burden on the parties in the first instance to propose a briefing sequence, jointly if possible but separately if not. The purpose of this requirement is to assist the reviewing court by giving it the benefit of the parties' views on what is the most efficient briefing sequence in the circumstances of the case. Subdivision (a)(2) then prescribes the role of the reviewing court: after considering the parties' proposal, the court will decide on the briefing sequence, prescribe the briefing periods, and notify the parties of both. The reviewing court, of course, may thereafter modify its order just as it may do in a single-appeal case. Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b).  Subdivision (b).   The purpose of subdivision (b)(3) is to ensure that in its reply brief a party addresses only issues germane to its own appeal. For example, a cross-appellant may not use its   cross-appellant's   reply brief to answer points raised in the   appellant's  reply brief.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",,,3358,

(Subd (a) adopted effective January 1, 2011.)  (b) Definitions  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: (1) A ""document"" is a pleading, a declaration, an exhibit, or another writing submitted by a party or other person, or by an agent of a party or other person on the party's or other person's behalf. A document is also a notice, order, judgment, or other issuance by the court. A document may be in paper or electronic form. (2) ""Electronic service"" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (3) ""Electronic transmission"" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (4) ""Electronic notification"" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (5) ""Electronic service address"" means the electronic address at or through which the party or other person has authorized electronic service. (6) An ""electronic filer"" is a party or other person filing a document in electronic form directly with the court, by an agent, or through an electronic filing service provider. (7) ""Electronic filing"" is the electronic transmission to a court of a document in electronic form. For the purposes of this chapter, this definition concerns the activity of filing and does not include the processing and review of the document, and its entry into the court records, which are necessary for a document to be officially filed. (8) An ""electronic filing service provider"" is a person or entity that receives an electronic filing from a party or other person for retransmission to the court or for electronic service on other parties or other persons, or both. In submission of filings, the electronic filing service provider does so on behalf of the electronic filer and not as an agent of the court. (9) An ""electronic filing manager"" is a service that acts as an intermediary between a court and various electronic filing service provider solutions certified for filing into California courts. (10) ""Self-represented"" means a party or other person who is unrepresented in an action by an attorney and does not include an attorney appearing in an action who represents himself or herself.

Advisory Committee Comment  The definition of ""electronic service"" has been amended to provide that a party may effectuate service not only by the electronic transmission of a document, but also by providing electronic notification of where a document served electronically may be located and downloaded. This amendment is intended to modify the rules on electronic service to expressly authorize electronic notification as a legally effective alternative means of service to electronic transmission. This rules amendment is consistent with the amendment of Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, effective January 1, 2011, to authorize service by electronic notification.

5.151,"Request for temporary emergency (ex parte) orders; application; required documents  (a) Application  The rules in this chapter govern applications for emergency orders (also known as ex parte applications) in family law cases, unless otherwise provided by statute or rule. These rules may be referred to as ""the emergency orders rules."" Unless specifically stated, these rules do not apply to ex parte applications for domestic violence restraining orders under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act.  (b) Purpose  The purpose of a request for emergency orders is to address matters that cannot be heard on the court's regular hearing calendar. In this type of proceeding, notice to the other party is shorter than in other proceedings. Notice to the other party can also be waived under exceptional and other circumstances as provided in these rules. The process is used to request that the court: (1) Make orders to help prevent an immediate danger or irreparable harm to a party or to the children involved in the matter; (2) Make orders to help prevent immediate loss or damage to property subject to disposition in the case; or (3) Make orders about procedural matters, including the following: (A) Setting a date for a hearing on the matter that is sooner than that of a regular hearing (granting an order shortening time for hearing); (B) Shortening or extending the time required for the moving party to serve the other party with the notice of the hearing and supporting papers (grant an order shortening time for service); and (C) Rescheduling a hearing or trial.  (c) Required documents  (1)   Request for order  A request for emergency orders must be in writing and must include all of the following completed documents: (A)   Request for Order   (form FL-300) that identifies the relief requested.

(C)   Temporary Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders   (form FL-305) to serve as the proposed temporary order. (D) A written declaration regarding notice of application for emergency orders based on personal knowledge.  Declaration Regarding Notice and Service of Request for Temporary Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders   (form FL-303), a local court form, or a declaration that contains the same information as form FL-303 may be used for this purpose.

The superior court clerk must also send a list of the exhibits sent. If the exhibits are not transmitted electronically, the superior court clerk must send two copies of the list. If the reviewing court clerk finds the list correct, the clerk must sign and return a copy to the superior court clerk. (2) Any party in possession of designated exhibits returned by the superior court must put them into numerical or alphabetical order and send them to the reviewing court. The party must also send a list of the exhibits sent. If the exhibits are not transmitted electronically, the party must send two copies of the list. If the reviewing court clerk finds the list correct, the clerk must sign and return a copy to the party.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (c) Application for later transmittal  After the periods specified in (a) have expired, a party may apply to the reviewing court for permission to send an exhibit to that court.  (d) Request and return by reviewing court  At any time the reviewing court may direct the superior court or a party to send it an exhibit. On request, the reviewing court may return an exhibit to the superior court or to the party that sent it. When the remittitur issues, the reviewing court must return all exhibits not transmitted electronically to the superior court or to the party that sent them.

8.248,"Prehearing conference  (a) Statement and conference  After the notice of appeal is filed in a civil case, the presiding justice may: (1) Order one or more parties to serve and file a concise statement describing the nature of the case and the issues presented; and (2) Order all necessary persons to attend a conference to consider case management issues, settlement, and other relevant matters.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Agreement  An agreement reached in a conference must be signed by the parties and filed. Unless the Court of Appeal orders otherwise, the agreement governs the appeal.  (c) Proceedings after conference  (1) Unless allowed by a filed agreement, no matter recited in a statement under (a)(1) or discussed in a conference under (a)(2) may be considered in any subsequent proceeding in the appeal other than in another conference. (2) If settlement is addressed at the conference, other than an inquiry solely about the parties' interest in settlement, neither the presiding officer nor any court personnel present at the conference may participate in or influence the determination of the appeal.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (d) Time to file brief  The time to file a party's brief under rule 8.212(a) is tolled from the date the Court of Appeal sends notice of the conference until the date it sends notice that the conference is concluded.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a)(1) requires each party to   serve   any statement it files. (Cf. rule 3.1380(c) [pretrial settlement conference statement must be served on each party].) The service requirement is not intended to prohibit the presiding justice from ordering the parties to submit additional, confidential material in appropriate cases.  Subdivision (d).   If a prehearing conference is ordered before the due date of the appellant's opening brief, the time to file the brief is not   extended   but   tolled,   in order to avoid unwarranted lengthening of the briefing process. For example, if the conference is ordered 15 days after the start of the normal 30-day briefing period, the rule simply   suspends   the running of that period; when the period resumes, the party will not receive an automatic extension of a full 30 days but rather the remaining 15 days of the original briefing period, unless the period is otherwise extended. Under subdivision (d) the tolling period continues ""until the date [the Court of Appeal] sends notice that the conference is  concluded""   (italics added). This provision is intended to accommodate the possibility that the conference may not conclude on the date it begins.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",,,3282,

If the clerk's office is closed on the date of finality, the court may file the order on the next day the clerk's office is open.  (b) Petition and answer  (1) A party may serve and file a petition for rehearing within 15 days after: (A) The filing of the decision; (B) A publication order restarting the finality period under rule 8.264(b)(3), if the party has not already filed a petition for rehearing; (C) A modification order changing the appellate judgment under rule 8.264(c)(2); or (D) The filing of a consent under rule 8.264(d). (2) A party must not file an answer to a petition for rehearing unless the court requests an answer. The clerk must promptly send to the parties copies of any order requesting an answer and immediately notify the parties by telephone or another expeditious method. Any answer must be served and filed within 8 days after the order is filed unless the court orders otherwise. A petition for rehearing normally will not be granted unless the court has requested an answer. (3) The petition and answer must comply with the relevant provisions of rule 8.204, including the length provisions in subdivision (c)(5).

Advisory Committee Comment  The rules on remote access do not apply beyond court records to other types of documents, information, or data. Rule 2.502 defines a court record as ""any document, paper, or exhibit filed in an action or proceeding; any order or judgment of the court; and any item listed in Government Code section 68151(a)-excluding any reporter's transcript for which the reporter is entitled to receive a fee for any copy-that is maintained by the court in the ordinary course of the judicial process. The term does not include the personal notes or preliminary memoranda of judges or other judicial branch personnel, statutorily mandated reporting between government entities, judicial administrative records, court case information, or compilations of data drawn from court records where the compilations are not themselves contained in a court record."" (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.502(3).) Thus, courts generate and maintain many types of information that are not court records and to which access may be restricted by law. Such information is not remotely accessible as court records, even to parties and their attorneys. If parties and their attorneys are entitled to access to any such additional information, separate and independent grounds for that access must exist.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",,,2590,

Multiple appeals from the   same judgment   include all cases in which opposing parties, or multiple parties on the same side of the case, appeal from the judgment. Multiple appeals from a judgment   and a related order   include all cases in which one party appeals from the judgment and another party appeals from any appealable order arising from or related to the judgment, i.e., not only orders contemplated by rule 8.108 (e.g., denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict) but also, for example, posttrial orders granting or denying attorney fees. The purpose is to encourage, when practicable, the preparation of a single record for all appeals taken in the same case. In specifying that ""only one   record   need be prepared,"" of course, the rule does not depart from the basic requirement that an   original   and at least one   copy   of the record be prepared.

In general, to be filed on time, a document must be received by the clerk before the time for filing that document expires. There are, however, some limited exceptions to this general rule. For example, (5) provides that if the superior court clerk receives a document by mail from a custodial institution after the deadline for filing the document has expired but the envelope shows that the document was mailed or delivered to custodial officials for mailing before the deadline expired, the document is deemed timely. This provision reflects the ""prison-delivery"" exception articulated by the California Supreme Court in   In re Jordan  (1992) 4 Cal.4th 116 and   Silverbrand v. County of Los Angeles   (2009) 46 Cal.4th 106. Note that if a deadline runs from the date of filing, it runs from the date that the document is actually received and deemed filed under (b)(1); neither (b)(3) nor (b)(5) changes that date. Nor do these provisions extend the date of finality of an appellate opinion or any other deadline that is based on finality, such as the deadline for the court to modify its opinion or order rehearing. Subdivision (b)(5) is also not intended to limit a criminal defendant's appeal rights under the case law of constructive filing. (See, e.g.,   In re Benoit   (1973) 10 Cal.3d 72.)

If the services of official court reporters are normally available in a department only for certain types of matters, those matters must be identified in the policy. (2)   Publication of policy  The court must publish its policy in a newspaper if one is published in the county. Instead of publishing the policy, the court may: (A) Send each party a copy of the policy at least 10 days before any hearing is held in a case; or (B) Adopt the policy as a local rule. (3)   Requests for official court reporter for civil trials and notices to parties  Unless the court's policy states that all courtrooms normally have the services of official court reporters available for civil trials, the court must require that each party file a statement before the trial date indicating whether the party requests the presence of an official court reporter. If a party requests the presence of an official court reporter and it appears that none will be available, the clerk must notify the party of that fact as soon as possible before the trial. If the services of official court reporters are normally available in all courtrooms, the clerk must notify the parties to a civil trial as soon as possible if it appears that those services will not be available. (4)   Notice of nonavailability of court reporter for nontrial matters  If the services of an official court reporter will not be available during a hearing on law and motion or other nontrial matters in civil cases, that fact must be noted on the court's official calendar.

(c) Party may procure reporter or request reporter if granted fee waiver  If the services of an official court reporter are not available for a hearing or trial in a civil case, a party may: (1) Arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter, whom the court must appoint unless there is good cause shown to refuse to do so. It is that party's responsibility to pay the reporter's fee for attendance at the proceedings, but the expense may be recoverable as part of the costs, as provided by law; or (2) If the party has been granted a fee waiver, request that the court provide an official reporter for attendance at the proceedings. The court must provide an official reporter if the party has been granted a fee waiver and if the court is not electronically recording the hearing or trial. (A) The request should be made by filing a   Request for Court Reporter by a Party with a Fee Waiver   (form FW-020). If the requesting party has not been granted a fee waiver, a completed   Request to Waive Court Fees   (form FW-001 or form FW-001-GC in guardianship or conservator cases) must be filed at the same time as the request for court reporter.

8.47,"Confidential records  (a) Application  This rule applies to confidential records but does not apply to records sealed by court order under rules 2.550-2.551 or rule 8.46 or to conditionally sealed records under rule 8.46. Unless otherwise provided by this rule or other law, rule 8.45 governs the form and transmission of and access to confidential records.  (b) Records of   Marsden   hearings and other in-camera proceedings  (1) This subdivision applies to reporter's transcripts of and documents filed or lodged by a defendant in connection with: (A) An in-camera hearing conducted by the superior court under   People v. Marsden   (1970) 2 Cal.3d 118; or (B) Another in-camera hearing at which the defendant was present but from which the People were excluded in order to prevent disclosure of information about defense strategy or other information to which the prosecution was not allowed access at the time of the hearing. (2) Except as provided in (3), if the defendant raises a   Marsden   issue or an issue related to another in-camera hearing covered by this rule in a brief, petition, or other filing in the reviewing court, the following procedures apply: (A) The brief, including any portion that discloses matters contained in the transcript of the in-camera hearing, and other documents filed or lodged in connection with the hearing, must be filed publicly. The requirement to publicly file this brief does not apply in juvenile cases; rule 8.401 governs the format of and access to such briefs in juvenile cases. (B) The People may serve and file an application requesting a copy of the reporter's transcript of, and documents filed or lodged by a defendant in connection with, the in-camera hearing. (C) Within 10 days after the application is filed, the defendant may serve and file opposition to this application on the basis that the transcript or documents contain confidential material not relevant to the issues raised by the defendant in the reviewing court. Any such opposition must identify the page and line numbers of the transcript or documents containing this irrelevant material. (D) If the defendant does not timely serve and file opposition to the application, the reviewing court clerk must send to the People a copy of the reporter's transcript of, and documents filed or lodged by a defendant in connection with, the in-camera hearing. (3) A defendant may serve and file a motion or application in the reviewing court requesting permission to file under seal a brief, petition, or other filing that raises a   Marsden   issue or an issue related to another in-camera hearing covered by this subdivision and requesting an order maintaining the confidentiality of the relevant material from the reporter's transcript of or documents filed or lodged in connection with the in-camera hearing. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, rule 8.46(d) governs a motion or application under this subdivision. (B) The declaration accompanying the motion or application must contain facts sufficient to justify an order maintaining the confidentiality of the relevant material from the reporter's transcript of, or documents filed or lodged in connection with, the in-camera hearing and sealing of the brief, petition, or other filing. (C) At the time the motion or application is filed, the defendant must: (i) File a public redacted version of the brief, petition, or other filing that he or she is requesting be filed under seal. The cover of this version must identify it as ""Public-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record."" The requirement to publicly file the redacted version does not apply in juvenile cases; rule 8.401 generally governs access to filings in juvenile cases.

8.63,"Policies and factors governing extensions of time  (a) Policies  (1) The time limits prescribed by these rules should generally be met to ensure expeditious conduct of appellate business and public confidence in the efficient administration of appellate justice. (2) The effective assistance of counsel to which a party is entitled includes adequate time for counsel to prepare briefs or other documents that fully advance the party's interests. Adequate time also allows the preparation of accurate, clear, concise, and complete submissions that assist the courts. (3) For a variety of legitimate reasons, counsel may not always be able to prepare briefs or other documents within the time specified in the rules of court. To balance the competing policies stated in (1) and (2), applications to extend time in the reviewing courts must demonstrate good cause--or an exceptional showing of good cause, when required by these rules--under (b). If good cause is shown, the court must extend the time.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Factors considered  In determining good cause--or an exceptional showing of good cause, when required by these rules--the court must consider the following factors when applicable: (1) The degree of prejudice, if any, to any party from a grant or denial of the extension. A party claiming prejudice must support the claim in detail. (2) In a civil case, the positions of the client and any opponent with regard to the extension. (3) The length of the record, including the number of relevant trial exhibits. A party relying on this factor must specify the length of the record. In a civil case, a record containing one volume of clerk's transcript or appendix and two volumes of reporter's transcript is considered an average-length record. (4) The number and complexity of the issues raised. A party relying on this factor must specify the issues. (5) Whether there are settlement negotiations and, if so, how far they have progressed and when they might be completed. (6) Whether the case is entitled to priority. (7) Whether counsel responsible for preparing the document is new to the case. (8) Whether other counsel or the client needs additional time to review the document. (9) Whether counsel responsible for preparing the document has other time-limited commitments that prevent timely filing of the document. Mere conclusory statements that more time is needed because of other pressing business will not suffice. Good cause requires a specific showing of other obligations of counsel that: (A) Have deadlines that as a practical matter preclude filing the document by the due date without impairing its quality; or (B) Arise from cases entitled to priority. (10) Illness of counsel, a personal emergency, or a planned vacation that counsel did not reasonably expect to conflict with the due date and cannot reasonably rearrange. (11) Any other factor that constitutes good cause in the context of the case.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)

8.80,"Statement of purpose  (a) Intent  The rules in this article are intended to provide the public with reasonable access to appellate court records that are maintained in electronic form, while protecting privacy interests .  (b) Benefits of electronic access  Improved technologies provide courts with many alternatives to the historical paper-based record receipt and retention process, including the creation and use of court records maintained in electronic form. Providing public access to appellate court records that are maintained in electronic form may save the courts and the public time, money, and effort and encourage courts to be more efficient in their operations. Improved access to appellate court records may also foster in the public a more comprehensive understanding of the appellate court system.  (c) No creation of rights  The rules in this article are not intended to give the public a right of access to any record that they are not otherwise entitled to access. The rules do not create any right of access to sealed or confidential records.  Rule 8.80 adopted effective January 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  The rules in this article acknowledge the benefits that electronic court records provide but attempt to limit the potential for unjustified intrusions into the privacy of individuals involved in litigation that can occur as a result of remote access to electronic court records. The proposed rules take into account the limited resources currently available in the appellate courts. It is contemplated that the rules may be modified to provide greater electronic access as the courts' technical capabilities improve and with the knowledge gained from the experience of the courts in providing electronic access under these rules.

2.1008,"Excuses from jury service  (a) Duty of citizenship  Jury service, unless excused by law, is a responsibility of citizenship. The court and its staff must employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important civic responsibility.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Principles  The following principles govern the granting of excuses from jury service by the jury commissioner on grounds of undue hardship under Code of Civil Procedure section 204: (1) No class or category of persons may be automatically excluded from jury duty except as provided by law. (2) A statutory exemption from jury service must be granted only when the eligible person claims it. (3) Deferring jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror for a temporary or marginal hardship. (4) Inconvenience to a prospective juror or an employer is not an adequate reason to be excused from jury duty, although it may be considered a ground for deferral.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Requests to be excused from jury service  All requests to be excused from jury service that are granted for undue hardship must be put in writing by the prospective juror, reduced to writing, or placed on the court's record. The prospective juror must support the request with facts specifying the hardship and a statement why the circumstances constituting the undue hardship cannot be avoided by deferring the prospective juror's service.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Reasons for excusing a juror because of undue hardship  An excuse on the ground of undue hardship may be granted for any of the following reasons: (1) The prospective juror has no reasonably available means of public or private transportation to the court. (2) The prospective juror must travel an excessive distance. Unless otherwise established by statute or local rule, an excessive distance is reasonable travel time that exceeds one-and-one-half hours from the prospective juror's home to the court. (3) The prospective juror will bear an extreme financial burden.

(3) ""Capable of performing jury service"" means a person can pay attention to evidence, testimony, and other court proceedings for up to six hours per day, with a lunch break and short breaks in the morning and afternoon, with or without disability-related accommodations, including auxiliary aids and services. (4) ""Health care provider"" means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, podiatrist, dentist, chiropractor, clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, clinical social worker, therapist, physician's assistant, Christian Science Practitioner, or any other medical provider, facility, or organization that is authorized and performing within the scope of the practice of their profession in accordance with state or federal law and regulations. (5) ""Permanent medical excuse"" means a release from jury service granted by the jury commissioner to a person with a disability whose condition is unlikely to resolve and who, with or without disability-related accommodations, including auxiliary aids or services, is not capable of performing jury service. (6) ""Person with a disability"" means an individual covered by Civil Code section 51 et seq., the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.), or other applicable state and federal laws. This definition includes a person who has a physical or mental medical condition that limits one or more of the major life activities, has a record of such a condition, or is regarded as having such a condition.  (b) Policy  (1) This rule is intended to allow a person with a disability whose condition is unlikely to resolve and who is unable for the foreseeable future to serve as a juror to seek a permanent medical excuse from jury service. This rule does not impose limitations on or invalidate the remedies, rights, and procedures accorded to persons with disabilities under state or federal law. (2) It is the policy of the courts of this state to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system, including the opportunity to serve as jurors. No eligible jurors who can perform jury service, with or without disability-related accommodations, including auxiliary aids or services, may be excused from jury service due solely to their disability.  (c) Process for requesting permanent medical excuse  The process for requesting a permanent medical excuse from jury service is as follows: (1) An applicant must submit to the jury commissioner a written request for permanent medical excuse with a supporting letter, memo, or note from a treating health care provider. The supporting letter, memo, or note must be on the treating health care provider's letterhead, state that the person has a permanent disability that makes the person incapable of performing jury service, and be signed by the provider. (2) The applicant must submit the request and supporting letter, memo, or note to the jury commissioner on or before the date the person is required to appear for jury service. (3) In the case of an incomplete application, the jury commissioner may require the applicant to furnish additional information in support of the request for permanent medical excuse.

3.1308,"Tentative rulings  (a) Tentative ruling procedures  A trial court that offers a tentative ruling procedure in civil law and motion matters must follow one of the following procedures: (1)   Notice of intent to appear required  The court must make its tentative ruling available by a method designated by the court, by no later than 3:00 p.m. the court day before the scheduled hearing. If the court desires oral argument, the tentative ruling must so direct. The tentative ruling may also note any issues on which the court wishes the parties to provide further argument. If the court has not directed argument, oral argument must be permitted only if a party notifies all other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the party’s intention to appear. A party must notify all other parties by telephone or in person. The court must accept notice by telephone and, at its discretion, may also designate alternative methods by which a party may notify the court of the party’s intention to appear. The tentative ruling will become the ruling of the court if the court has not directed oral argument by its tentative ruling and notice of intent to appear has not been given. (2)   No notice of intent to appear required  The court must make its tentative ruling available by a method designated by the court, by a specified time before the hearing. The tentative ruling may note any issues on which the court wishes the parties to provide further argument at the hearing. This procedure must not require the parties to give notice of intent to appear, and the tentative ruling will not automatically become the ruling of the court if such notice is not given. The tentative ruling, or such other ruling as the court may render, will not become the final ruling of the court until the hearing.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2025; previously amended effective July 1, 2000, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) No other procedures permitted  Other than following one of the tentative ruling procedures authorized in (a), courts must not issue tentative rulings except: (1) By posting a calendar note containing tentative rulings on the day of the hearing; or (2) By announcing the tentative ruling at the time of oral argument.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously repealed and adopted effective July 1, 2000.)  (c) Notice of procedure  A court that follows one of the procedures described in (a) must so state in its local rules. The local rule must specify the method for obtaining the tentative rulings and the time by which the rulings will be available.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2025; previously amended effective July 1, 2000, and January 1, 2007.)

8.240,"Calendar preference  A party seeking calendar preference must promptly serve and file a motion for preference in the reviewing court. As used in this rule, ""calendar preference"" means an expedited appeal schedule, which may include expedited briefing and preference in setting the date of oral argument.  Rule 8.240 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; repealed and adopted as rule 19 effective January 1, 2003.  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 8.240 requires a party claiming preference to file a motion for preference in the reviewing court. The motion requirement relieves the reviewing court of the burden of searching the record to determine if preference should be ordered. The requirement is not intended to bar the court from ordering preference without a motion when the ground is apparent on the face of the appeal, e.g., in appeals from judgments of dependency (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 395). The rule is broad in scope: it includes motions for preference on the grounds (1) that a statute provides for preference in the reviewing court (e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 44 [probate proceedings, contested elections, libel by public official), 45 [judgment freeing minor from parental custody]); (2) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference when a statute provides for trial preference (e.g., id., §§ 35 [certain election matters], 36 [party over 70 and in poor health; party with terminal illness; minor in wrongful death action]; see Warren v. Schecter (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1198-1199); and (3) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference on a nonstatutory ground (e.g., economic hardship). Because valid grounds for preference could arise after the filing of the reply brief, e.g., a diagnosis of terminal illness, the rule requires the motion to be filed ""promptly,"" i.e., as soon as the ground for preference arises.

If the parties have designated a clerk's or a reporter's transcript and the record has not been filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant must also immediately serve a copy of the notice on the superior court clerk. (2) If the case settles after the appellant receives a notice setting oral argument or a prehearing conference, the appellant must also immediately notify the Court of Appeal of the settlement by telephone or other expeditious method. (3) Within 45 days after filing a notice of settlement-unless the court has ordered a longer time period on a showing of good cause-the appellant who filed the notice of settlement must file either an abandonment under (b), if the record has not yet been filed in the Court of Appeal, or a request to dismiss under (c), if the record has already been filed in the Court of Appeal. (4) If the appellant does not file an abandonment, a request to dismiss, or a letter stating good cause why the appeal should not be dismissed within the time period specified under (3), the court may dismiss the appeal as to that appellant and order each side to bear its own costs on appeal. (5) This subdivision does not apply to settlements requiring findings to be made by the Court of Appeal under Code of Civil Procedure section 128(a)(8).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.)  (b) Abandonment  (1) Before the record is filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant may serve and file in superior court an abandonment of the appeal or a stipulation to abandon the appeal. The filing effects a dismissal of the appeal and restores the superior court's jurisdiction. (2) The superior court clerk must promptly notify the Court of Appeal and the parties of the abandonment or stipulation.  (c) Request to dismiss  (1) After the record is filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant may serve and file in that court a request or a stipulation to dismiss the appeal. (2) On receipt of a request or stipulation to dismiss, the court may dismiss the appeal and direct immediate issuance of the remittitur.  (d) Approval of compromise  If a guardian or conservator seeks approval of a proposed compromise of a pending appeal, the Court of Appeal may, before ruling on the compromise, direct the trial court to determine whether the compromise is in the minor's or the conservatee's best interests and to report its findings.

(b) Form and content  The letter may provide only a citation to the new authority and identify, by citation to a page or pages in a brief on file, the issue on appeal to which the new authority is relevant. No argument or other discussion of the authority is permitted in the letter.

The presiding justice may shorten the notice period for good cause; in that event, the clerk/executive officer must immediately notify the parties by telephone or other expeditious method.

(c) Conduct of argument  Unless the court provides otherwise by local rule or order: (1) The appellant, petitioner, or moving party has the right to open and close.

If multiple parties are represented by separate counsel, or if an amicus curiae-on written request-is granted permission to argue, the court may apportion or expand the time. (3) Only one counsel may argue for each separately represented party.

(2) If the Supreme Court transfers a cause to the Court of Appeal and supplemental briefs may be filed under rule 8.200(b), the cause is submitted when the last such brief is or could be timely filed.

The statutory procedures include limited discovery, optional case questionnaires, optional requests for pretrial statements identifying trial witnesses and exhibits, and the possibility of presenting testimony in the form of affidavits or declarations.  (b) Case management  The case management rules in chapter 3 of division 7 of these rules, starting at rule 3.720, are applicable to all cases with mandatory expedited jury trials, except to the extent the rules have been modified by local court rules applicable to limited civil cases.  (c) Opting out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures  (1) Parties seeking to opt out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures on grounds stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 630.20(b) must file a   Request to Opt Out of Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures   (form EJT-003). (2) Except on a showing of good cause, the request to opt out must be served and filed at least 45 days before the date first set for trial or, in cases in which the date first set for trial occurred before July 1, 2016, 45 days before the first trial date after July 1, 2016.

(4) If the grounds on which a party or parties have opted out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures no longer apply to a case, the parties must promptly inform the court, and the case may be tried as a mandatory expedited jury trial.

(d) Agreements regarding pretrial and trial procedures  Parties are encouraged to agree to procedures or limitations on pretrial procedures and on presentation of information at trial that could streamline the case, including but not limited to those items described in rule 3.1547(b). The parties may use  Agreement of Parties (Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures)   (form EJT-018) and the attachment (form EJT-022A) to describe such agreements.  Rule 3.1546 amended effective September 1, 2017; adopted effective July 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  Because Code of Civil Procedure section 630.20, which becomes operative July 1, 2016, applies to cases already on file and possibly already set for trial, as well as cases filed after the statutory provisions go into effect, the deadlines in rule 3.1546(c) for opt outs and objections may be problematic as applied to cases set for trial within the first couple of months after the rule goes into effect. It is expected that the good cause provisions within the rules regarding deadlines, along with judicious use of continuances as appropriate, will be liberally used to permit courts to manage those cases fairly, appropriately, and efficiently.

Subdivision (b)(2)(B)-(D) recognizes several additional types of Supreme Court decisions that are final on filing. Thus (b)(2)(B) recognizes that a dismissal, a transfer, and a retransfer under (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of rule 8.528 are decisions final on filing. A remand under rule 8.528(c) is not a decision final on filing because it is not a separately filed order; rather, as part of its appellate judgment at the end of its opinion in such cases the Supreme Court simply orders the cause remanded to the Court of Appeal for disposition of the remaining issues in the appeal. Subdivision (b)(2)(C) recognizes that an order denying a petition for a writ within the court's original jurisdiction without issuance of an alternative writ or order to show cause is final on filing. The provision reflects the settled Supreme Court practice, since at least 1989, of declining to file petitions for rehearing in such matters. (See, e.g.,   In re Hayes   (S004421) Minutes, Cal. Supreme Ct., July 28, 1989 [""The motion to vacate this court's order of May 18, 1989 [denying a petition for habeas corpus without opinion] is denied. Because the California Rules of Court do not authorize the filing of a petition for rehearing of such an order, the alternate request to consider the matter as a petition for rehearing is denied.""].)

1.300,"Access to programs, services, and professionals  (a) Definitions  As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, the following definitions apply: (1) ""Court-provided programs, services, and professionals"" are services offered and provided by court employees or by contractors or vendors under agreement with the court. (2) ""Court litigant"" is a person who is a party in a court case or other legal proceeding. (3) ""Language services"" are services designed to provide access to the legal system to limited English proficient court litigants and may include in-person interpretation, telephonic interpreter services, video remote interpreting services, and services provided by assigned bilingual employees and bilingual volunteers. (4) ""Limited English proficient"" describes a person who speaks English ""less than very well"" and who, as a result, cannot understand or participate in a court proceeding. (5) ""Private programs, services, and professionals"" are services provided by outside agencies, organizations, and persons that court litigants may be required to access by court order.  (b) Provision of language services in court-ordered and court-provided programs, services, and professionals  As soon as feasible, each court must adopt procedures to enable limited English proficient court litigants to access court- ordered and court-provided programs, services, and professionals to the same extent as persons who are proficient in English.  (c) Provision of language services in private programs and services, and by private professionals  To the extent feasible, a court should avoid ordering a limited English proficient court litigant to a private program, service, or professional that is not language accessible.  (d) Delay in access to services  If a limited English proficient court litigant is unable to access a private program, service, or professional within the time period ordered by the court due to limitations in language service availability, the court litigant may submit a statement to the court indicating the reason for the delay, and the court may, for good cause, enter an alternative order or extend the time for completion. Court litigants may use   Service Not Available in My Language: Request to Change Court Order   (form LA- 400) for this purpose. The court may respond to the request using   Service Not Available in My Language: Order   (form LA-450).  (e) Use of technology  Courts should seek out opportunities to collaborate with each other and with community partners in the provision of language services, and should employ technology to promote the sharing of bilingual staff and certified and registered court interpreters among courts, as appropriate.  Rule 1.300 adopted effective September 1, 2019.  Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b).   The goal of this rule is to connect limited English proficient court litigants ordered by courts to access programs or professionals with services in the languages spoken by the litigants. Recognizing that not all program providers will be willing or able to meet the language needs, the rule is intended to help courts become aware of those language services available in the community so that limited English proficient court litigants are not placed in a position where they are unable to comply with court orders because the required services are not available in a language they understand. To facilitate equal access to justice, when courts order limited English proficient litigants to access court-provided programs, services, and professionals, to the greatest extent possible, courts should ensure that the services are language accessible.

8.811,"Policies and factors governing extensions of time  (a) Policies  (1) The time limits prescribed by these rules should generally be met to ensure expeditious conduct of appellate business and public confidence in the efficient administration of appellate justice. (2) The effective assistance of counsel to which a party is entitled includes adequate time for counsel to prepare briefs or other documents that fully advance the party's interests. Adequate time also allows the preparation of accurate, clear, concise, and complete submissions that assist the courts. (3) For a variety of legitimate reasons, counsel or self-represented litigants may not always be able to prepare briefs or other documents within the time specified in the rules of court. To balance the competing policies stated in (1) and (2), applications to extend time in the appellate division must demonstrate good cause under (b). If good cause is shown, the court must extend the time.  (b) Factors considered  In determining good cause, the court must consider the following factors when applicable: (1) The degree of prejudice, if any, to any party from a grant or denial of the extension. A party claiming prejudice must support the claim in detail. (2) In a civil case, the positions of the client and any opponent with regard to the extension. (3) The length of the record, including the number of relevant trial exhibits. A party relying on this factor must specify the length of the record. (4) The number and complexity of the issues raised. A party relying on this factor must specify the issues. (5) Whether there are settlement negotiations and, if so, how far they have progressed and when they might be completed. (6) Whether the case is entitled to priority. (7) Whether counsel responsible for preparing the document is new to the case. (8) Whether other counsel or the client needs additional time to review the document. (9) Whether counsel or a self-represented party responsible for preparing the document has other time-limited commitments that prevent timely filing of the document. Mere conclusory statements that more time is needed because of other pressing business will not suffice. Good cause requires a specific showing of other obligations of counsel or a self-represented party that: (A) Have deadlines that as a practical matter preclude filing the document by the due date without impairing its quality; or (B) Arise from cases entitled to priority. (10) Illness of counsel or a self-represented party, a personal emergency, or a planned vacation that counsel or a self- represented party did not reasonably expect to conflict with the due date and cannot reasonably rearrange. (11) Any other factor that constitutes good cause in the context of the case.  Rule 8.811 adopted effective January 1, 2009.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",,,2846,

(c) Procedure for consideration of good cause for failure to appear or pay  (1) A notice of a civil assessment under section 1214.1(b) must inform the defendant of his or her right to petition that the civil assessment be vacated for good cause and must include information about the process for vacating or reducing the assessment. (2) When a notice of civil assessment is given, a defendant may, within the time specified in the notice, move by written petition to vacate or reduce the assessment. (3) When a court imposes a civil assessment for failure to appear or pay, the defendant may petition that the court vacate or reduce the civil assessment without paying any bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments. (4) A petition to vacate an assessment does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessment unless specifically ordered by the court. (5) The court must vacate the assessment upon a showing of good cause under section 1214.1(b)(1) for failure to appear or failure to pay. (6) If the defendant does not establish good cause, the court may still exercise its discretion under section 1214.1(a) to reconsider: (A) Whether a civil assessment should be imposed; and (B) If so, the amount of the assessment. (7) In exercising its discretion, the court may consider such factors as a defendant's due diligence in appearing or paying after notice of the assessment has been given under section 1214.1(b)(1) and the defendant's financial circumstances.  (d) Procedure for unpaid bail referred to collection as delinquent debt in unadjudicated cases  (1) When a case has not been adjudicated and a court refers it to a comprehensive collection program as provided in section 1463.007(b)(1) as delinquent debt, the defendant may schedule a hearing for adjudication of the underlying charge(s) without payment of the bail amount. (2) The defendant may request an appearance date to adjudicate the underlying charges by written petition or alternative method provided by the court. Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance. (3) A court may require a deposit of bail before adjudication of the underlying charges if the court finds that the defendant is unlikely to appear as ordered without a deposit of bail and the court expressly states the reasons for the finding. The court must not require payment of the civil assessment before adjudication.  (e) Procedure for failure to pay or make a payment under an installment payment plan  (1) When a defendant fails to pay a fine or make a payment under an installment plan as provided in section 1205 or Vehicle Code sections 40510.5, 42003, or 42007, the court must permit the defendant to appear by written petition to modify the payment terms.

By providing an electronic address or number to the court or to a law enforcement officer at the time of signing the promise to appear, a defendant consents to receiving the reminder notice electronically at that electronic address or number. (3) If the court cannot comply with (1) because the defendant does not have a valid mailing address or with (2) because the court does not have the necessary information or the technological capability to send reminder notices electronically, the court need not send a reminder notice.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 22, 2019.)  (b) Purpose  This rule is intended to: (1) Assist courts issuing criminal protective orders to determine whether a defendant subject to such an order owns, possesses, or controls any firearms; and (2) Assist courts that have issued criminal protective orders to determine whether a defendant has complied with the court's order to relinquish or sell the firearms under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9.  (c) Setting review hearing  (1) At any hearing where the court issues a criminal protective order, the court must consider all credible information, including information provided on behalf of the defendant, to determine if there is good cause to believe that the defendant has a firearm within his or her immediate possession or control. (2) If the court finds good cause to believe that the defendant has a firearm within his or her immediate possession or control, the court must set a review hearing to ascertain whether the defendant has complied with the requirement to relinquish the firearm as specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9. Unless the defendant is in custody at the time, the review hearing should occur within two court days after issuance of the criminal protective order. If circumstances warrant, the court may extend the review hearing to occur within 5 court days after issuance of the criminal protective order. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to present information at the review hearing to refute the allegation that he or she owns any firearms. If the defendant is in custody at the time the criminal protective order is issued, the court should order the defendant to appear for a review hearing within two court days after the defendant's release from custody. (3) If the proceeding is held under Penal Code section 136.2, the court may, under Penal Code section 977(a)(2), order the defendant to personally appear at the review hearing. If the proceeding is held under Penal Code section 1203.097, the court should order the defendant to personally appear.  (d) Review hearing  (1) If the court has issued a criminal protective order under Penal Code section 136.2, at the review hearing: (A) If the court finds that the defendant has a firearm in or subject to his or her immediate possession or control, the court must consider whether bail, as set, or defendant's release on own recognizance is appropriate. (B) If the defendant does not appear at the hearing and the court orders that bail be revoked, the court should issue a bench warrant. (2) If the criminal protective order is issued as a condition of probation under Penal Code section 1203.097, and the court finds at the review hearing that the defendant has a firearm in or subject to his or her immediate possession or control, the court must proceed under Penal Code section 1203.097(a)(12).

Absent an order upon showing of good cause, the cases or child support orders must be consolidated into a single court file according to the following priority, including those cases or orders initiated or obtained by a local child support agency under division 17 of the Family Code that are consolidated under either section 1048(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure or section 17408 of the Family Code: (A) If one of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation brought under division 6 of the Family Code, all cases and orders so consolidated must be consolidated into that action, which must be the primary file. (B) If none of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation, but one of the child support orders to be consolidated has been issued in an action under the Uniform Parentage Act (Fam.

(C) If none of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation or in an action under the Uniform Parentage Act, but one of the child support orders to be consolidated has been issued in an action commenced by a Petition for Custody and Support of Minor Children (form FL-260), all orders so consolidated must be consolidated into that action, which must be the primary file. (D) If none of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation or in an action under the Uniform Parentage Act, the case or cases with the higher number or numbers must be consolidated into the case with the lowest number, which must be the primary file. Child support orders in cases brought under the Domestic Violence Protection Act (Fam. Code, div. 10, pt. 4) or any similar law may be consolidated under this rule. However, a domestic violence case must not be designated as the primary file. (2)   Notice of consolidation  Upon issuance of the consolidation order, the local child support agency must prepare and file in each subordinate case a   Notice of Consolidation   (form FL-920), indicating that the support orders in those actions are consolidated into the primary file. The notice must state the date of the consolidation, the primary file number, and the case number of each of the cases so consolidated.

All further orders must be issued only in the primary action, and no further orders may be issued in a subordinate court file. All enforcement and modification of support orders in consolidated cases must occur in the primary court action regardless of in which action the order was originally issued.

4.102,"Uniform bail and penalty schedules-traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, business licensing  The Judicial Council of California has established the policy of promulgating uniform bail and penalty schedules for certain offenses in order to achieve a standard of uniformity in the handling of these offenses. In general, bail is used to ensure the presence of the defendant before the court. Under Vehicle Code sections 40512 and 13103, bail may also be forfeited and forfeiture may be ordered without the necessity of any further court proceedings and be treated as a conviction for specified Vehicle Code offenses. A penalty in the form of a monetary sum is a fine imposed as all or a portion of a sentence imposed. To achieve substantial uniformity of bail and penalties throughout the state in traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing cases, the trial court judges, in performing their duty under Penal Code section 1269b to annually revise and adopt a schedule of bail and penalties for all misdemeanor and infraction offenses except Vehicle Code infractions, must give consideration to the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules approved by the Judicial Council. The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule for infraction violations of the Vehicle Code will be established by the Judicial Council in accordance with Vehicle Code section 40310. Judges must give consideration to requiring additional bail for aggravating or enhancing factors. After a court adopts a countywide bail and penalty schedule, under Penal Code section 1269b, the court must, as soon as practicable, mail or e-mail a copy of the schedule to the Judicial Council with a report stating how the revised schedule differs from the council's uniform traffic bail and penalty schedule, uniform boating bail and penalty schedule, uniform fish and game bail and penalty schedule, uniform forestry bail and penalty schedule, uniform public utilities bail and penalty schedule, uniform parks and recreation bail and penalty schedule, or uniform business licensing bail and penalty schedule. The purpose of this uniform bail and penalty schedule is to: (1) Show the standard amount for bail, which for Vehicle Code offenses may also be the amount used for a bail forfeiture instead of further proceedings; and (2) Serve as a guideline for the imposition of a fine as all or a portion of the penalty for a first conviction of a listed offense where a fine is used as all or a portion of the penalty for such offense. The amounts shown for the misdemeanors on the boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing bail and penalty schedules have been set with this dual purpose in mind. Unless otherwise shown, the maximum penalties for the listed offenses are six months in the county jail or a fine of $1,000, or both. The penalty amounts are intended to be used to provide standard fine amounts for a first offense conviction of a violation shown where a fine is used as all or a portion of the sentence imposed.
