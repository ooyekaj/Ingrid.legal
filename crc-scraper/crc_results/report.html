            <div class="rule-title">Format of discovery motions  (a) Separate statement required  Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a motion: (1) To compel further responses to requests for admission; (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories; (3) To compel further responses to a demand for inspection of documents or tangible things; (4) To compel answers at a deposition; (5) To compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things at a deposition; (6) For medical examination over objection; and (7) For issue or evidentiary sanctions.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 1987, January 1, 1992, January 1, 1997, and July 1, 2001.)  (b) Separate statement not required  A separate statement is not required under the following circumstances: (1) When no response has been provided to the request for discovery; or (2) When a court has allowed the moving party to submit-in place of a separate statement-a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted effective July 1, 2001.)  (c) Contents of separate statement  A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue. The separate statement must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full response. Material must not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference. The separate statement must include-for each discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for admission, deposition question, or inspection demand) to which a further response, answer, or production is requested-the following: (1) The text of the request, interrogatory, question, or inspection demand; (2) The text of each response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers; (3) A statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses, answers, or production as to each matter in dispute; (4) If necessary, the text of all definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each discovery request and the responses to it; (5) If the response to a particular discovery request is dependent on the response given to another discovery request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other discovery request, the other request and the response to it must be set forth; and (6) If the pleadings, other documents in the file, or other items of discovery are relevant to the motion, the party relying on them must summarize each relevant document.

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 8.74</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Format of electronic documents  (a) Formatting requirements applicable to all electronic documents  (1)   Text-searchable portable document format : Electronic documents must be in text-searchable portable document format (PDF) while maintaining the original document formatting. In the limited circumstances in which a document cannot practicably be converted to a text-searchable PDF, the document may be scanned or converted to non-text- searchable PDF. An electronic filer is not required to use a specific vendor, technology, or software for creation of a searchable-format document, unless the electronic filer agrees to such use. The software for creating and reading electronic documents must be in the public domain or generally available at a reasonable cost. The printing of an electronic document must not result in the loss of document text, formatting, or appearance. The electronic filer is responsible for ensuring that any document filed is complete and readable. (2)   Pagination : The electronic page counter for the electronic document must match the page number for each page of the document. The page numbering of a document filed electronically must begin with the first page or cover page as page 1 and thereafter be paginated consecutively using only arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3). The page number for the cover page may be suppressed and need not appear on the cover page. When a document is filed in both paper form and electronic form, the pagination in both versions must comply with this paragraph. (3)   Bookmarking : An electronic bookmark is a descriptive text link that appears in the bookmarks panel of an electronic document. Each electronic document must include an electronic bookmark to each heading, subheading, and the first page of any component of the document, including any table of contents, table of authorities, petition, verification, memorandum, declaration, certificate of word count, certificate of interested entities or persons, proof of service, exhibit, or attachment. Each electronic bookmark must briefly describe the item to which it is linked. For example, an electronic bookmark to a heading must provide the text of the heading, and an electronic bookmark to an exhibit or attachment must include the letter or number of the exhibit or attachment and a brief description of the exhibit or attachment. An electronic appendix must have bookmarks to the indexes and to the first page of each separate exhibit or attachment. Exhibits or attachments within an exhibit or attachment must be bookmarked. All bookmarks must be set to retain the reader's selected zoom setting. (4)   Protection of sensitive information : Electronic filers must comply with rules 1.201, 8.45, 8.46, 8.47, and 8.401 regarding the protection of sensitive information, except for those requirements exclusively applicable to paper form. (5)   Size and multiple files : An electronic filing may not be larger than 25 megabytes. This rule does not change the limitations on word count or number of pages otherwise established by the California Rules of Court for documents filed in the court. Although certain provisions in the California Rules of Court require volumes of no more than 300 pages (see, e.g., rules 8.124(d)(1), 8.144(b)(6), 8.144(g)), an electronic filing may exceed 300 pages so long as its individual components comply with the 300-page volume requirement and the electronic filing does not exceed 25 megabytes. If a document exceeds the 25-megabyte file-size limitation, the electronic filer must submit the document in more than one file, with each file 25 megabytes or less. The first file must include a master chronological and alphabetical index stating the contents for all files. Each file must have a cover page stating (a) the file number for that file and the total number of files for that document, (b) the volumes contained in that file, and (c) the page numbers contained in that file. (For example: File 2 of 4, Volumes 3-4, pp. 301-499.) In addition, each file must be paginated consecutively across all files in the document, including the cover pages for each file. (For example, if the first file ends on page 300, the cover of the second file must be page 301.) If a multiple-file document is submitted to the court in both electronic form and paper form, the cover pages for each file must be included in the paper documents. (6)   Manual Filing : (A) When an electronic filer seeks to file an electronic document consisting of more than 10 files, or when the document cannot or should not be electronically filed in multiple files, or when electronically filing the document  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

            <div class="rule-title">Actions by court on receipt of electronic filing  (a) Confirmation of receipt and filing of document  (1)   Confirmation of receipt  When a court receives an electronically submitted document, the court must promptly send the electronic filer confirmation of the court's receipt of the document, indicating the date and time of receipt. A document is considered received at the date and time the confirmation of receipt is created. (2)   Confirmation of filing  If the document received by the court under (1) complies with filing requirements and all required filing fees have been paid, the court must promptly send the electronic filer confirmation that the document has been filed. The filing confirmation must indicate the date and time of filing and is proof that the document was filed on the date and at the time specified. The filing confirmation must also specify: (A) Any transaction number associated with the filing; (B) The titles of the documents as filed by the court; and (C) The fees assessed for the filing. (3)   Transmission of confirmations  The court must send receipt and filing confirmation to the electronic filer at the electronic service address the filer furnished to the court under rule 2.256(a)(4). The court must maintain a record of all receipt and filing confirmations. (4)   Filer responsible for verification  In the absence of the court's confirmation of receipt and filing, there is no presumption that the court received and filed the document. The electronic filer is responsible for verifying that the court received and filed any document that the electronic filer submitted to the court electronically.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2011; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2008.)  (b) Notice of rejection of document for filing  If the clerk does not file a document because it does not comply with applicable filing requirements or because the required filing fee has not been paid, the court must promptly send notice of the rejection of the document for filing to the electronic filer. The notice must state the reasons that the document was rejected for filing.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Delayed delivery  If a technical problem with a court's electronic filing system prevents the court from accepting an electronic filing on a particular court day, and the electronic filer demonstrates that he or she attempted to electronically file the document on that day, the court must deem the document as filed on that day. This subdivision does not apply to the filing of a complaint or any other initial pleading in an action or proceeding.  (Subd (c) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2018; adopted as subd (d); previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Endorsement  (1) The court's endorsement of a document electronically filed must contain the following: "Electronically filed by Superior Court of California, County of ________, on _____ (date)," followed by the name of the court clerk. (2) The endorsement required under (1) has the same force and effect as a manually affixed endorsement stamp with the signature and initials of the court clerk.

(2) A respondent must serve and file its brief within 30 days after the appellant files its opening brief. (3) An appellant must serve and file its reply brief, if any, within 20 days after the respondent files its brief.

(b) Extensions of time  (1) Except as otherwise provided by statute or when the time to file the brief has previously been extended under (3) or rule 8.220(d), the parties may extend each period under (a) by up to 60 days by filing one or more stipulations in the reviewing court before the brief is due. Stipulations must be signed by and served on all parties. (2) A stipulation under (1) is effective on filing. The reviewing court may not shorten a stipulated extension. (3) Before the brief is due, a party may apply to the presiding justice for an extension of each period under (a), or under rule 8.200(c)(6) or (7), on a showing that there is good cause and that: (A) The applicant was unable to obtain-or it would have been futile to seek-the extension by stipulation; or (B) The parties have stipulated to the maximum extension permitted under (1) and the applicant seeks a further extension. (4) A party need not apply for an extension or relief from default if it can file its brief within the time prescribed by rule 8.220(a). The clerk must file a brief submitted within that time if it otherwise complies with these rules.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2015; previously amended effective January 1, 2003, July 1, 2005, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2010, January 1, 2011, January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2014.)  (c) Service  (1) One copy of each brief must be served on the superior court clerk for delivery to the trial judge. (2) If a brief is not filed electronically under rules 8.70-8.79, one electronic copy of each brief must be submitted to the Court of Appeal. For purposes of this requirement, the term "brief" does not include a petition for rehearing or an answer thereto. (A) The copy must be a single computer file in text-searchable Portable Document Format (PDF), and it must exactly duplicate the appearance of the paper copy, including the order and pagination of all of the brief's components. By electronically submitting the copy, the filer certifies that the copy complies with these requirements and that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that the copy does not contain computer code, including viruses, that might be harmful to the court's system for receipt of electronic copies or to other users of that system. (B) If the brief discloses material contained in a sealed or conditionally sealed record, the party serving the brief must comply with rule 8.46(f) and include as the first page in the PDF document a cover sheet that contains the information required by rule 8.204(b)(10). (C) If it would cause undue hardship for the party filing the brief to submit an electronic copy of the brief to the Court of Appeal, the party may instead serve four paper copies of the brief on the Supreme Court. If the brief discloses material contained in a sealed or conditionally sealed record, the party serving the brief must comply with rule 8.46(f) and attach a cover sheet that contains the information required by rule 8.204(b)(10).

            <div class="rule-title">Requirements for signatures on documents  (a) Electronic signature  An electronic signature is an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign a document or record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means.  (Subd (a) adopted effective January 1, 2019.)  (b) Documents signed under penalty of perjury  When a document to be filed electronically provides for a signature under penalty of perjury of any person, the document is deemed to have been signed by that person if filed electronically provided that either of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) The declarant has signed the document using an electronic signature and declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of California that the information submitted is true and correct. If the declarant is not the electronic filer, the electronic signature must be unique to the declarant, capable of verification, under the sole control of the declarant, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is invalidated; or (2) The declarant, before filing, has physically signed a printed form of the document. By electronically filing the document, the electronic filer certifies that the original, signed document is available for inspection and copying at the request of the court or any other party. In the event this second method of submitting documents electronically under penalty of perjury is used, the following conditions apply: (A) At any time after the electronic version of the document is filed, any party may serve a demand for production of the original signed document. The demand must be served on all other parties but need not be filed with the court. (B) Within five days of service of the demand under (A), the party or other person on whom the demand is made must make the original signed document available for inspection and copying by all other parties. (C) At any time after the electronic version of the document is filed, the court may order the filing party or other person to produce the original signed document in court for inspection and copying by the court. The order must specify the date, time, and place for the production and must be served on all parties. (D) Notwithstanding (A)-(C), local child support agencies may maintain original, signed pleadings by way of an electronic copy in the statewide automated child support system and must maintain them only for the period of time stated in Government Code section 68152(a). If the local child support agency maintains an electronic copy of the original, signed pleading in the statewide automated child support system, it may destroy the paper original.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2022; adopted effective July 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Mandatory electronic filing by local rule  A court may require parties by local rule to electronically file documents in civil actions directly with the court, or directly with the court and through one or more approved electronic filing service providers, or through more than one approved electronic filing service provider, subject to the conditions in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, the rules in this chapter, and the following conditions: (1) The court must specify the types or categories of civil actions in which parties or other persons are required to file and serve documents electronically. The court may designate any of the following as eligible for mandatory electronic filing and service: (A) All civil cases; (B) All civil cases of a specific category, such as unlimited or limited civil cases; (C) All civil cases of a specific case type, including but not limited to, contract, collections, personal injury, or employment; (D) All civil cases assigned to a judge for all purposes; (E) All civil cases assigned to a specific department, courtroom or courthouse; (F) Any class actions, consolidated actions, or group of actions, coordinated actions, or actions that are complex under rule 3.403; or (G) Any combination of the cases described in subparagraphs (A) to (F), inclusive. (2) Self-represented parties or other self-represented persons are exempt from any mandatory electronic filing and service requirements adopted by courts under this rule and Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (3) In civil cases involving both represented and self-represented parties or other persons, represented parties or other persons may be required to file and serve documents electronically; however, in these cases, each self-represented party or other person is to file, serve, and be served with documents by non-electronic means unless the self- represented party or other person affirmatively agrees otherwise. (4) A party or other person that is required to file and serve documents electronically must be excused from the requirements if the party or other person shows undue hardship or significant prejudice. A court requiring the electronic filing and service of documents must have a process for parties or other persons, including represented parties or other represented persons, to apply for relief and a procedure for parties or other persons excused from filing documents electronically to file them by conventional means. (5) Any fees charged by the court or an electronic filing service provider shall be consistent with the fee provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (6) The effective date of filing any document received electronically is prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. This provision concerns only the effective date of filing. Any document that is received electronically must be processed and satisfy all other legal filing requirements to be filed as an official court record.

(2) A "document" is: Any writing submitted to the reviewing court by a party or other person, including a brief, a petition, an appendix, or a motion. A document is also any writing transmitted by a trial court to the reviewing court, including a notice or a clerk's or reporter's transcript, and Any writing prepared by the reviewing court, including an opinion, an order, or a notice. A document may be in paper or electronic form. (3) "Electronic service" is service of a document on a party or other person by either electronic transmission or electronic notification.

            <div class="rule-title">Contracts with electronic filing service providers  (a) Right to contract  (1) The court may contract with one or more electronic filing service providers to furnish and maintain an electronic filing system for the court. (2) If the court contracts with an electronic filing service provider, the court may require electronic filers to transmit the documents to the provider. (3) If the court contracts with an electronic service provider or the court has an in-house system, the provider or system must accept filing from other electronic filing service providers to the extent the provider or system is compatible with them.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2011.)  (b) Provisions of contract  The court's contract with an electronic filing service provider may allow the provider to charge electronic filers a reasonable fee in addition to the court's filing fee. Whenever possible, the contract should require that the electronic filing service provider agree to waive a fee that normally would be charged to a party when the court orders that the fee be waived for that party. The contract may also allow the electronic filing service provider to make other reasonable requirements for use of the electronic filing system.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017.)  (c) Transmission of filing to court  An electronic filing service provider must promptly transmit any electronic filing and any applicable filing fee to the court.

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 8.216</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Appeals in which a party is both appellant and respondent  (a) Briefing sequence and time to file briefs  In an appeal in which any party is both an appellant and a respondent: (1) The parties must jointly-or separately if unable to agree-submit a proposed briefing sequence to the reviewing court within 20 days after the second notice of appeal is filed. (2) After receiving the proposal, the reviewing court must order a briefing sequence and prescribe briefing periods consistent with rule 8.212(a). (3) Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Contents of briefs  (1) A party that is both an appellant and a respondent must combine its respondent's brief with its appellant's opening brief or its reply brief, if any, whichever is appropriate under the briefing sequence that the reviewing court orders. (2) A combined brief must address the points raised in each appeal separately but may include a single summary of the significant facts. (3) A party must confine a reply brief, or the reply portion of a combined brief, to points raised in its appeal.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2009; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 8.216 applies, first, to all cases in which opposing parties both appeal from the judgment. In addition, it applies to all cases in which one party appeals from the judgment and another party appeals from any appealable order arising from or related to the judgment, i.e., not only orders contemplated by rule 8.108 (denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict) but also, for example, posttrial orders granting or denying attorney fees. The purpose of the rule is to provide, in all such appeals, a single unified procedure for resolving uncertainties as to the order in which the parties must file their briefs. As used in this rule, "appellant" includes cross-appellant and "respondent" includes cross-respondent. (Compare rule 8.100(e).)  Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a) implements the above-stated purpose by providing a procedure for determining both the briefing  sequence -i.e., the order in which the parties must file their briefs-and the briefing   periods -i.e., the periods of time (e.g., 30 days or 70 days, etc.) within which the briefs must be filed. Subdivision (a)(1) places the burden on the parties in the first instance to propose a briefing sequence, jointly if possible but separately if not. The purpose of this requirement is to assist the reviewing court by giving it the benefit of the parties' views on what is the most efficient briefing sequence in the circumstances of the case. Subdivision (a)(2) then prescribes the role of the reviewing court: after considering the parties' proposal, the court will decide on the briefing sequence, prescribe the briefing periods, and notify the parties of both. The reviewing court, of course, may thereafter modify its order just as it may do in a single-appeal case. Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b).  Subdivision (b).   The purpose of subdivision (b)(3) is to ensure that in its reply brief a party addresses only issues germane to its own appeal. For example, a cross-appellant may not use its   cross-appellant's   reply brief to answer points raised in the   appellant's  reply brief.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

The notice must include the electronic service address at which the party or other person agrees to accept service; or (B) Manifesting affirmative consent through electronic means with the court or the court's electronic filing service provider, and concurrently providing the party's electronic service address with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic service. A party or other person may manifest affirmative consent by serving notice of consent to all parties and other persons and either: (i) Agreeing to the terms of service with an electronic filing service provider, which clearly states that agreement constitutes consent to receive electronic service; or (ii) Filing Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address (form EFS-005-CV). (2) A party or other person that has consented to electronic service under (1) and has used an electronic filing service provider to serve and file documents in a case consents to service on that electronic filing service provider as the designated agent for service for the party or other person in the case, until such time as the party or other person designates a different agent for service.

(c) Electronic service required by local rule or court order  (1) A court may require parties to serve documents electronically in specified civil actions by local rule or court order, as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and the rules in this chapter. (2) A court may require other persons to serve documents electronically in specified civil actions by local rule, as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and the rules in this chapter. (3) Except when personal service is otherwise required by statute or rule, a party or other person that is required to file documents electronically in an action must also serve documents and accept service of documents electronically from all other parties or persons, unless: (A) The court orders otherwise, or (B) The action includes parties or persons that are not required to file or serve documents electronically, including self-represented parties or other self-represented persons; those parties or other persons are to be served by non-electronic methods unless they affirmatively consent to electronic service. (4) Each party or other person that is required to serve and accept service of documents electronically must provide all other parties or other persons in the action with its electronic service address and must promptly notify all other parties, other persons, and the court of any changes under (g).

To appeal after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or after an admission of probation violation, the defendant must also comply with (b). (2) As used in (1), "felony case" means any criminal action in which a felony is charged, regardless of the outcome. A felony is "charged" when an information or indictment accusing the defendant of a felony is filed or a complaint accusing the defendant of a felony is certified to the superior court under Penal Code section 859a. A felony case includes an action in which the defendant is charged with: (A) A felony and a misdemeanor or infraction, but is convicted of only the misdemeanor or infraction; (B) A felony, but is convicted of only a lesser offense; or (C) An offense filed as a felony but punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor, and the offense is thereafter deemed a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17(b). (3) If the defendant appeals, the defendant or the defendant's attorney must sign the notice of appeal. If the People appeal, the attorney for the People must sign the notice. (4) The notice of appeal must be liberally construed. Except as provided in (b), the notice is sufficient if it identifies the particular judgment or order being appealed. The notice need not specify the court to which the appeal is taken; the appeal will be treated as taken to the Court of Appeal for the district in which the superior court is located.

(B) Within 20 days after the defendant files a written statement under Penal Code section 1237.5, the superior court must sign and file either a certificate of probable cause or an order denying the certificate. (2) Appeal not requiring a certificate of probable cause To appeal from a superior court judgment after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or after an admission of probation violation on grounds that do not affect the validity of the plea or admission, the defendant need not file the written statement required by Penal Code section 1237.5 for issuance of a certificate of probable cause. No certificate of probable cause is required for an appeal based on or from: (A) The denial of a motion to suppress evidence under Penal Code section 1538.5; (B) The sentence or other matters occurring after the plea or admission that do not affect the validity of the plea or admission; or (C) An appealable order for which, by law, no certificate of probable cause is required.

(b) Appeal of decision denying relief on a successive habeas corpus petition  (1) The petitioner may appeal the decision of the superior court denying relief on a successive death penalty-related habeas corpus petition only if the superior court or the Court of Appeal grants a certificate of appealability under Penal Code section 1509.1(c). (2) The petitioner must identify in the notice of appeal that the appeal is from a superior court decision denying relief on a successive petition and indicate whether the superior court granted or denied a certificate of appealability. (3) If the superior court denied a certificate of appealability, the petitioner must attach to the notice of appeal a request to the Court of Appeal for a certificate of appealability. The request must identify the petitioner's claim or claims for relief and explain how the requirements of Penal Code section 1509(d) have been met. (4) On receiving the request for a certificate of appealability, the Court of Appeal clerk must promptly file the request and send notice of the filing date to the parties. (5) The People need not file an answer to a request for a certificate of appealability unless the court requests an answer. The clerk must promptly send to the parties and the assisting entity or counsel copies of any order requesting an answer and immediately notify the parties by telephone or another expeditious method. Any answer must be served on the parties and the assisting entity or counsel and filed within five days after the order is filed unless the court orders otherwise. (6) The Court of Appeal must grant or deny the request for a certificate of appealability within 10 days of the filing of the request in that court. If the Court of Appeal grants a certificate of appealability, the certificate must identify the substantial claim or claims for relief shown by the petitioner.

The appellant or the appellant's attorney must sign the notice. (2) The notice of appeal must be liberally construed.

The fee may be paid by check or money order payable to "Clerk/Executive Officer, Court of Appeal"; if the fee is paid in cash, the clerk must give a receipt. The fee may also be paid by any method permitted by the court pursuant to rules 2.258 and 8.78.

Circumstances that may indicate good cause include: (1) The unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (2) The unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3) The unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4) The substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of justice; (5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's involvement in the case; (6) A party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or (7) A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 2000.)  (b) Memorandum  Notwithstanding any other rule of court, no memorandum is required to be filed or served with a motion to be relieved as counsel.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective July 1, 2000.)  (c) Declaration  The motion to be relieved as counsel must be accompanied by a declaration on the   Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil   (form MC-052). The declaration must state in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as subd (b); previously relettered and amended effective July 1, 2000.)  (d) Service  The notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case. The notice may be by personal service, electronic service, or mail. (1) If the notice is served on the client by mail under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either: (A) The service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or (B) The service address is the last known residence or business address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved. (2) If the notice is served on the client by electronic service under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and rule 2.251, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the electronic service address is the client's current electronic service address. As used in this rule, "current" means that the address was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved. Merely demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client's last known address and was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current. If the service is by mail, Code of Civil Procedure section 1011(b) applies.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2017; adopted as subd (c); previously relettered and amended effective July 1, 2000; previously amended effective July 1, 1991, January 1, 1996, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2009.)  (e) Order  The proposed order relieving counsel must be prepared on the   Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel- Civil   (form MC-053) and must be lodged with the court with the moving papers. The order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. If no hearing date is presently scheduled, the court may set one and specify the date in the order. After the order is signed, a copy of the signed order must be served on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case. The court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.

            <div class="rule-title">Applications to file overlength briefs in appeals from a judgment of death  (a) Cases in which this rule applies  This rule applies in appeals from a judgment of death in which the certified record is filed in the California Supreme Court on or after January 1, 2008.  (b) Policies  (1) The brief limits set by rule 8.630 are substantially higher than for other appellate briefs in recognition of the number, significance, and complexity of the issues generally presented in appeals from judgments of death and are designed to be sufficient to allow counsel to prepare adequate briefs in the majority of such appeals. (2) In a small proportion of such appeals, counsel may not be able to prepare adequate briefs within the limits set by rule 8.630. In those cases, necessary additional briefing will be permitted. (3) A party may not file a brief that exceeds the limit set by rule 8.630 unless the court finds that good cause has been shown in an application filed within the time limits set in (d).  (c) Factors considered  The court will consider the following factors in determining whether good cause exists to grant an application to file a brief that exceeds the limit set by rule 8.630: (1) The unusual length of the record. A party relying on this factor must specify the length of each of the following components of the record: (A) The reporter's transcript; (B) The clerk's transcript; and (C) The portion of the clerk's transcript that is made up of juror questionnaires. (2) The number of codefendants in the case and whether they were tried separately from the appellant; (3) The number of homicide victims in the case and whether the homicides occurred in more than one incident; (4) The number of other crimes in the case and whether they occurred in more than one incident; (5) The number of rulings by the trial court on unusual, factually intensive, or legally complex motions that the party may assert are erroneous and prejudicial. A party relying on this factor must briefly describe the nature of these motions; (6) The number of rulings on objections by the trial court that the party may assert are erroneous and prejudicial; (7) The number and nature of unusual, factually intensive, or legally complex hearings held in the trial court that the party may assert raise issues on appeal; and (8) Any other factor that is likely to contribute to an unusually high number of issues or unusually complex issues on appeal. A party relying on this factor must briefly specify those issues.  (d) Time to file and contents of application  (1) An application to file a brief that exceeds the limits set by rule 8.630 must be served and filed as follows: (A) For an appellant's opening brief or respondent's brief: (i) If counsel has not filed an application requesting an extension of time to file the brief, no later than 45 days before the brief is due. (ii) If counsel has filed an application requesting an extension of time to file the brief, within the time specified by the court in its order regarding the extension of time.

The appellant may combine its notice designating the record with its notice of appeal.  (b) Contents  (1) The notice must: (A) Specify the date the notice of appeal was filed. (B) Specify which form of the record of the written documents from the superior court proceedings listed in rule 8.120(a)(1) the appellant elects to use. If the appellant elects to use a clerk's transcript, the notice must also designate the documents to be included in the clerk's transcript as required under rule 8.122(b)(1). (C) Specify whether the appellant elects to proceed with or without a record of the oral proceedings in the trial court. If the appellant elects to proceed with a record of the oral proceedings in the trial court, the notice must specify which form of the record listed in rule 8.120(b) the appellant elects to use. If the appellant elects to use a reporter's transcript, the notice must designate the proceedings to be included in the transcript as required under rule 8.130. (2) If an appellant intends to raise any issue that requires consideration of the record of an administrative proceeding that was admitted in evidence, refused, or lodged in the superior court, the notice must also request that this administrative record be transmitted to the reviewing court under rule 8.123.  (c) Copy to the reviewing court  The clerk must promptly send the reviewing court a copy of any notice filed under this rule.  Rule 8.121 adopted effective January 1, 2008.  Advisory Committee Comment  The Judicial Council has adopted an optional form- Appellant's Notice Designating Record on Appeal ( form APP-003)-that can be used to provide the notice required by this rule. This rule makes the filing of a notice designating the record an "act required to procure the record" within the meaning of rule 8.140(a). Under that rule, a failure to file such a notice triggers the clerk's duty to issue a 15-day notice of default and thereby allows the appellant to cure the default in superior court.

In the event this second method of submitting documents electronically under penalty of perjury is used, the following conditions apply: (A) At any time after the electronic version of the document is filed, any other party may serve a demand for production of the original signed document. The demand must be served on all other parties but need not be filed with the court.

(C) At any time after the electronic version of the document is filed, the court may order the electronic filer to produce the original signed document for inspection and copying by the court.

            <div class="rule-title">Duty to notify court and others of settlement of entire case  (a) Notice of settlement  (1)   Court and other persons to be notified  If an entire case is settled or otherwise disposed of, each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must immediately file written notice of the settlement or other disposition with the court and serve the notice on all parties and any arbitrator or other court-connected alternative dispute resolution (ADR) neutral involved in the case. Each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must also immediately give oral notice to all of the above if a hearing, conference, or trial is scheduled to take place within 10 days. (2)   Compensation for failure to provide notice  If the plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief does not notify an arbitrator or other court-connected ADR neutral involved in the case of a settlement at least 2 days before the scheduled hearing or session with that arbitrator or neutral, the court may order the party to compensate the arbitrator or other neutral for the scheduled hearing time. The amount of compensation ordered by the court must not exceed the maximum amount of compensation the arbitrator would be entitled to receive for service as an arbitrator under Code of Civil Procedure section 1141.18(b) or that the neutral would have been entitled to receive for service as a neutral at the scheduled hearing or session.

If the plaintiff or other party required to serve and file the request for dismissal does not do so, the court must dismiss the entire case 45 days after it receives notice of settlement unless good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2009; adopted effective January 1, 1989; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2006.)  (c) Conditional settlement  (1)   Notice  If the settlement agreement conditions dismissal of the entire case on the satisfactory completion of specified terms that are not to be performed within 45 days of the settlement, including payment in installment payments, the notice of conditional settlement served and filed by each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must specify the date by which the dismissal is to be filed. (2)   Dismissal  If the plaintiff or other party required to serve and file a request for dismissal within 45 days after the dismissal date specified in the notice does not do so, the court must dismiss the entire case unless good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed. (3)   Hearings vacated  (A) Except as provided in (B), on the filing of the notice of conditional settlement, the court must vacate all hearings and other proceedings requiring the appearance of a party and may not set any hearing or other proceeding requiring the appearance of a party earlier than 45 days after the dismissal date specified in the notice, unless requested by a party.

An OSC must be used when a temporary restraining order (TRO) is sought, or if the party against whom the preliminary injunction is sought has not appeared in the action. If the responding party has not appeared, the OSC must be served in the same manner as a summons and complaint.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective July 1, 1997; previously amended effective July 1, 1999.)  (b) Filing of complaint or obtaining of court file  If the action is initiated the same day a TRO or an OSC is sought, the complaint must be filed first. The moving party must provide a file-stamped copy of the complaint to the judge who will hear the application. If an application for a TRO or an OSC is made in an existing case, the moving party must request that the court file be made available to the judge hearing the application.

The OSC must describe the injunction to be sought at the hearing. The TRO must describe the activities to be enjoined pending the hearing. A proposed OSC must contain blank spaces for the time and manner of service on responding parties, the date on which the proof of service must be delivered to the court hearing the OSC, a briefing schedule, and, if applicable, the expiration date of the TRO.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective July 1, 1997; previously amended effective July 1, 1999.)  (d) Personal attendance  The moving party or counsel for the moving party must be personally present when the request for a TRO is made.

(e) Previous applications  An application for a TRO or an OSC must state whether there has been any previous application for similar relief and, if so, the result of the application.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as subd (f) effective July 1, 1997; previously amended and relettered effective July 1, 1999.)  (f) Undertaking  Notwithstanding rule 3.1312, whenever an application for a preliminary injunction is granted, a proposed order must be presented to the judge for signature, with an undertaking in the amount ordered, within one court day after the granting of the application or within the time ordered. Unless otherwise ordered, any restraining order previously granted remains in effect during the time allowed for presentation for signature of the order of injunction and undertaking. If the proposed order and the undertaking required are not presented within the time allowed, the TRO may be vacated without notice. All bonds and undertakings must comply with rule 3.1130.

(Subd (b) amended and relettered effective July 1, 2002; adopted as subd (c); previously amended effective January 1, 1995.)  (c) Settlement conference statement  No later than five court days before the initial date set for the settlement conference, each party must submit to the court and serve on each party a mandatory settlement conference statement containing: (1) A good faith settlement demand; (2) An itemization of economic and noneconomic damages by each plaintiff; (3) A good faith offer of settlement by each defendant; and (4) A statement identifying and discussing in detail all facts and law pertinent to the issues of liability and damages involved in the case as to that party.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (d)   This provision is not intended to discourage settlement conferences or mediations. However, problems have arisen in several cases, such as   Jeld-Wen v. Superior Court of San Diego County   (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 536, when distinctions between different ADR processes have been blurred. To prevent confusion about the confidentiality of the proceedings, it is important to clearly distinguish between settlement conferences held under this rule and mediations. The special confidentiality requirements for mediations established by Evidence Code sections 1115-1128 expressly do not apply to settlement conferences under this rule. This provision is not intended to prohibit a court from appointing a person who has previously served as a mediator in a case to conduct a settlement conference in that case following the conclusion of the mediation.

(2) Service under (1)(A) and (B) may be by any method permitted by the Code of Civil Procedure, including electronic service when permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and rules 2.250-2.261. (3) If the parties stipulated in the trial court under Code of Civil Procedure section 1019.5 to waive notice of the court order being appealed, the time to appeal under (1)(C) applies unless the court or a party serves notice of entry of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment to start the time period under (1)(A) or (B).

If a notice of appeal is filed late, the reviewing court must dismiss the appeal.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2005.)  (c) What constitutes entry  For purposes of this rule: (1) The entry date of a judgment is the date the judgment is filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 668.5, or the date it is entered in the judgment book. (2) The entry date of an appealable order that is entered in the minutes is the date it is entered in the permanent minutes. But if the minute order directs that a written order be prepared, the entry date is the date the signed order is filed; a written order prepared under rule 3.1312 or similar local rule is not such an order prepared by direction of a minute order. (3) The entry date of an appealable order that is not entered in the minutes is the date the signed order is filed. (4) The entry date of a decree of distribution in a probate proceeding is the date it is entered at length in the judgment book or other permanent court record. (5) An order signed electronically has the same effect as an order signed on paper.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2017; adopted as subd (c); previously amended effective January 1, 2007; previously relettered as subd (d) effective January 1, 2005, and as subd (c) effective January 1, 2011.)  (d) Premature notice of appeal  (1) A notice of appeal filed after judgment is rendered but before it is entered is valid and is treated as filed immediately after entry of judgment. (2) The reviewing court may treat a notice of appeal filed after the superior court has announced its intended ruling, but before it has rendered judgment, as filed immediately after entry of judgment.

(2) If the trial court makes a finding of excessive or inadequate damages and grants the motion for a new trial subject to the condition that the motion is denied if a party consents to the additur or remittitur of damages, the time to appeal is extended as follows: (A) If a party serves an acceptance of the additur or remittitur within the time for accepting the additur or remittitur, the time to appeal from the judgment is extended for all parties until 30 days after the date the party serves the acceptance. (B) If a party serves a rejection of the additur or remittitur within the time for accepting the additur or remittitur or if the time for accepting the additur or remittitur expires, the time to appeal from the new trial order is extended for all parties until the earliest of 30 days after the date the party serves the rejection or 30 days after the date on which the time for accepting the additur or remittitur expired.

            <div class="rule-title">Time to appeal  (a) Normal time  (1) Unless a statute or rule 8.823 provides otherwise, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: (A) 30 days after the trial court clerk serves the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled "Notice of Entry" of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, showing the date it was served; (B) 30 days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled "Notice of Entry" of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (C) 90 days after the entry of judgment. (2) Service under (1)(A) and (B) may be by any method permitted by the Code of Civil Procedure, including electronic service when permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and rules 2.250-2.261. (3) If the parties stipulated in the trial court under Code of Civil Procedure section 1019.5 to waive notice of the court order being appealed, the time to appeal under (1)(C) applies unless the court or a party serves notice of entry of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment to start the time period under (1)(A) or (B).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and March 1, 2014.)  (b) What constitutes entry  For purposes of this rule: (1) The entry date of a judgment is the date the judgment is filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 668.5 or the date it is entered in the judgment book. (2) The date of entry of an appealable order that is entered in the minutes is the date it is entered in the permanent minutes. But if the minute order directs that a written order be prepared, the entry date is the date the signed order is filed; a written order prepared under rule 3.1312 or similar local rule is not such an order prepared by direction of a minute order. (3) The entry date of an order that is not entered in the minutes is the date the signed order is filed.  (c) Premature notice of appeal  (1) A notice of appeal filed after judgment is rendered but before it is entered is valid and is treated as filed immediately after entry of judgment. (2) The appellate division may treat a notice of appeal filed after the trial court has announced its intended ruling, but before it has rendered judgment, as filed immediately after entry of judgment.  (d) Late notice of appeal  If a notice of appeal is filed late, the appellate division must dismiss the appeal.  Rule 8.822 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2009; previously amended effective January 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, March 1, 2014.  Advisory Committee Comment  Under rule 8.804(23), the term "judgment" includes any order that may be appealed.  Subdivision (d).

(Subd (a) adopted effective January 1, 2011.)  (b) Definitions  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: (1) A "document" is a pleading, a declaration, an exhibit, or another writing submitted by a party or other person, or by an agent of a party or other person on the party's or other person's behalf. A document is also a notice, order, judgment, or other issuance by the court. A document may be in paper or electronic form. (2) "Electronic service" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (3) "Electronic transmission" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (4) "Electronic notification" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (5) "Electronic service address" means the electronic address at or through which the party or other person has authorized electronic service. (6) An "electronic filer" is a party or other person filing a document in electronic form directly with the court, by an agent, or through an electronic filing service provider. (7) "Electronic filing" is the electronic transmission to a court of a document in electronic form. For the purposes of this chapter, this definition concerns the activity of filing and does not include the processing and review of the document, and its entry into the court records, which are necessary for a document to be officially filed. (8) An "electronic filing service provider" is a person or entity that receives an electronic filing from a party or other person for retransmission to the court or for electronic service on other parties or other persons, or both. In submission of filings, the electronic filing service provider does so on behalf of the electronic filer and not as an agent of the court. (9) An "electronic filing manager" is a service that acts as an intermediary between a court and various electronic filing service provider solutions certified for filing into California courts. (10) "Self-represented" means a party or other person who is unrepresented in an action by an attorney and does not include an attorney appearing in an action who represents himself or herself.

Advisory Committee Comment  The definition of "electronic service" has been amended to provide that a party may effectuate service not only by the electronic transmission of a document, but also by providing electronic notification of where a document served electronically may be located and downloaded. This amendment is intended to modify the rules on electronic service to expressly authorize electronic notification as a legally effective alternative means of service to electronic transmission. This rules amendment is consistent with the amendment of Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, effective January 1, 2011, to authorize service by electronic notification. (See Stats. 2010, ch. 156 (Sen. Bill 1274).) The amendments change the law on electronic service as understood by the  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

            <div class="rule-title">Procedures for filing records under seal  (a) Court approval required  A record must not be filed under seal without a court order. The court must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Motion or application to seal a record  (1)   Motion or application required  A party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing. (2)   Service of motion or application  A copy of the motion or application must be served on all parties that have appeared in the case. Unless the court orders otherwise, any party that already has access to the records to be placed under seal must be served with a complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a redacted version. Other parties must be served with only the public redacted version. If a party's attorney but not the party has access to the record, only the party's attorney may be served with the complete, unredacted version. (3)   Procedure for party not intending to file motion or application  (A) A party that files or intends to file with the court, for the purposes of adjudication or to use at trial, records produced in discovery that are subject to a confidentiality agreement or protective order, and does not intend to request to have the records sealed, must: (i) Lodge the unredacted records subject to the confidentiality agreement or protective order and any pleadings, memorandums, declarations, and other documents that disclose the contents of the records, in the manner stated in (d); (ii) File copies of the documents in (i) that are redacted so that they do not disclose the contents of the records that are subject to the confidentiality agreement or protective order; and (iii) Give written notice to the party that produced the records that the records and the other documents lodged under (i) will be placed in the public court file unless that party files a timely motion or application to seal the records under this rule. (B) If the party that produced the documents and was served with the notice under (A)(iii) fails to file a motion or an application to seal the records within 10 days or to obtain a court order extending the time to file such a motion or an application, the clerk must promptly transfer all the documents in (A)(i) from the envelope, container, or secure electronic file to the public file. If the party files a motion or an application to seal within 10 days or such later time as the court has ordered, these documents are to remain conditionally under seal until the court rules on the motion or application and thereafter are to be filed as ordered by the court. (4)   Lodging of record pending determination of motion or application  The party requesting that a record be filed under seal must lodge it with the court under (d) when the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for not lodging it or the record has previously been lodged under (3)(A) (i). Pending the determination of the motion or application, the lodged record will be conditionally under seal. (5)   Redacted and unredacted versions  If necessary to prevent disclosure, any motion or application, any opposition, and any supporting documents must be filed in a public redacted version and lodged in a complete, unredacted version conditionally under seal.

If they are transmitted electronically, they must be transmitted to the court in a secure manner that preserves the confidentiality of the documents to be lodged. (2) If the petitioner is transmitting the petition on paper, the petitioner must complete and affix to the envelope a completed   Confidential Cover Sheet-Name Change Proceeding Under Address Confidentiality Program   ( Safe at Home)   (form NC-400) and in the space under the title and case number mark it "CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL." If the petitioner is transmitting the petition electronically, the first page of the electronic transmission must be a completed  Confidential Cover Sheet-Name Change Proceeding Under Address Confidentiality Program   ( Safe at Home)   (form NC-400) with the space under the title and case number marked "CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL." (3) On receipt of a petition lodged under this rule, the clerk must endorse the cover sheet with the date of its receipt and must retain but not file the record unless the court orders it filed. (4) If the court denies the application to seal, the moving party may notify the court that the lodged record is to be filed unsealed. This notification must be received within 10 days of the order denying the motion or application to seal, unless otherwise ordered by the court. On receipt of this notification, the clerk must unseal and file the record. If the moving party does not notify the court within 10 days of the order, the clerk must (1) return the lodged record to the moving party if it is in paper form or (2) permanently delete the lodged record if it is in electronic form.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (e) Consideration of application to file under seal  The court may order that the record be filed under seal if it finds that all of the following factors apply: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed order to seal the record is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.

These rules may be referred to as "the emergency orders rules." Unless specifically stated, these rules do not apply to ex parte applications for domestic violence restraining orders under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act.  (b) Purpose  The purpose of a request for emergency orders is to address matters that cannot be heard on the court's regular hearing calendar. In this type of proceeding, notice to the other party is shorter than in other proceedings. Notice to the other party can also be waived under exceptional and other circumstances as provided in these rules. The process is used to request that the court: (1) Make orders to help prevent an immediate danger or irreparable harm to a party or to the children involved in the matter; (2) Make orders to help prevent immediate loss or damage to property subject to disposition in the case; or (3) Make orders about procedural matters, including the following: (A) Setting a date for a hearing on the matter that is sooner than that of a regular hearing (granting an order shortening time for hearing); (B) Shortening or extending the time required for the moving party to serve the other party with the notice of the hearing and supporting papers (grant an order shortening time for service); and (C) Rescheduling a hearing or trial.  (c) Required documents  (1)   Request for order  A request for emergency orders must be in writing and must include all of the following completed documents: (A)   Request for Order   (form FL-300) that identifies the relief requested. (B) When relevant to the relief requested, a current   Income and Expense Declaration   (form FL-150) or   Financial Statement (Simplified)   (form FL-155) and   Property Declaration   (form FL-160). (C)   Temporary Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders   (form FL-305) to serve as the proposed temporary order. (D) A written declaration regarding notice of application for emergency orders based on personal knowledge.  Declaration Regarding Notice and Service of Request for Temporary Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders   (form FL-303), a local court form, or a declaration that contains the same information as form FL-303 may be used for this purpose.

The superior court clerk must also send a list of the exhibits sent. If the exhibits are not transmitted electronically, the superior court clerk must send two copies of the list. If the reviewing court clerk finds the list correct, the clerk must sign and return a copy to the superior court clerk. (2) Any party in possession of designated exhibits returned by the superior court must put them into numerical or alphabetical order and send them to the reviewing court. The party must also send a list of the exhibits sent. If the exhibits are not transmitted electronically, the party must send two copies of the list.

(d) Request and return by reviewing court  At any time the reviewing court may direct the superior court or a party to send it an exhibit. On request, the reviewing court may return an exhibit to the superior court or to the party that sent it.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Agreement  An agreement reached in a conference must be signed by the parties and filed. Unless the Court of Appeal orders otherwise, the agreement governs the appeal.  (c) Proceedings after conference  (1) Unless allowed by a filed agreement, no matter recited in a statement under (a)(1) or discussed in a conference under (a)(2) may be considered in any subsequent proceeding in the appeal other than in another conference. (2) If settlement is addressed at the conference, other than an inquiry solely about the parties' interest in settlement, neither the presiding officer nor any court personnel present at the conference may participate in or influence the determination of the appeal.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (d) Time to file brief  The time to file a party's brief under rule 8.212(a) is tolled from the date the Court of Appeal sends notice of the conference until the date it sends notice that the conference is concluded.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.) Rule 8.248 amended effective January 1, 2016; repealed and adopted as rule 21 effective January 1, 2003; previously amended and renumbered as rule 8.248 effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a)(1) requires each party to   serve   any statement it files. (Cf. rule 3.1380(c) [pretrial settlement conference statement must be served on each party].) The service requirement is not intended to prohibit the presiding justice from ordering the parties to submit additional, confidential material in appropriate cases.  Subdivision (d).   If a prehearing conference is ordered before the due date of the appellant's opening brief, the time to file the brief is not   extended   but   tolled,   in order to avoid unwarranted lengthening of the briefing process. For example, if the conference is ordered 15 days after the start of the normal 30-day briefing period, the rule simply   suspends   the running of that period; when the period resumes, the party will not receive an automatic extension of a full 30 days but rather the remaining 15 days of the original briefing period, unless the period is otherwise extended. Under subdivision (d) the tolling period continues "until the date [the Court of Appeal] sends notice that the conference is  concluded"   (italics added). This provision is intended to accommodate the possibility that the conference may not conclude on the date it begins.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

            <div class="rule-title">Rehearing  (a) Power to order rehearing  (1) On petition of a party or on its own motion, a reviewing court may order rehearing of any decision that is not final in that court on filing. (2) An order for rehearing must be filed before the decision is final. If the clerk's office is closed on the date of finality, the court may file the order on the next day the clerk's office is open.  (b) Petition and answer  (1) A party may serve and file a petition for rehearing within 15 days after: (A) The filing of the decision; (B) A publication order restarting the finality period under rule 8.264(b)(3), if the party has not already filed a petition for rehearing; (C) A modification order changing the appellate judgment under rule 8.264(c)(2); or (D) The filing of a consent under rule 8.264(d). (2) A party must not file an answer to a petition for rehearing unless the court requests an answer. The clerk must promptly send to the parties copies of any order requesting an answer and immediately notify the parties by telephone or another expeditious method. Any answer must be served and filed within 8 days after the order is filed unless the court orders otherwise. A petition for rehearing normally will not be granted unless the court has requested an answer. (3) The petition and answer must comply with the relevant provisions of rule 8.204, including the length provisions in subdivision (c)(5). (4) Before the decision is final and for good cause, the presiding justice may relieve a party from a failure to file a timely petition or answer.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2004, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2009.)  (c) No extension of time  The time for granting or denying a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeal may not be extended.

            <div class="rule-title">Application, scope, and information to the public  (a) Application and scope  The rules in this chapter apply only to trial court records as defined in rule 2.502(3). They do not apply to statutorily mandated reporting between or within government entities, or any other documents or materials that are not court records.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2019; adopted as subd (b) effective July 1, 2002; amended and relettered effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Information to the public  The website for each trial court must include a link to information that will inform the public of who may access their electronic records under the rules in this chapter and under what conditions they may do so. This information will be posted publicly on the California Courts website at   www.courts.ca.gov . Each trial court may post additional information, in plain language, as necessary to inform the public about the level of access that the particular trial court is providing.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2019; adopted as subd (c) effective July 1, 2002; amended and relettered effective January 1, 2007.) Rule 2.501 amended effective January 1, 2019; adopted as rule 2017 effective July 1, 2002; amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  The rules on remote access do not apply beyond court records to other types of documents, information, or data. Rule 2.502 defines a court record as "any document, paper, or exhibit filed in an action or proceeding; any order or judgment of the court; and any item listed in Government Code section 68151(a)-excluding any reporter's transcript for which the reporter is entitled to receive a fee for any copy-that is maintained by the court in the ordinary course of the judicial process. The term does not include the personal notes or preliminary memoranda of judges or other judicial branch personnel, statutorily mandated reporting between government entities, judicial administrative records, court case information, or compilations of data drawn from court records where the compilations are not themselves contained in a court record." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.502(3).) Thus, courts generate and maintain many types of information that are not court records and to which access may be restricted by law. Such information is not remotely accessible as court records, even to parties and their attorneys. If parties and their attorneys are entitled to access to any such additional information, separate and independent grounds for that access must exist.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

(2) If there is more than one separately represented appellant, they must equally share the cost of preparing the record, unless otherwise agreed by the appellants or ordered by the superior court.

(b) Later appeal  In an appeal in which the parties are using either a clerk's transcript under rule 8.122 or a reporter's transcript under rule 8.130: (1) A party wanting to incorporate by reference all or parts of a record in a prior appeal in the same case must specify those parts in its designation of the record. (A) The prior appeal must be identified by its case name and number. If only part of a record is being incorporated by reference, that part must be identified by citation to the volume, where applicable, and page numbers of the record where it appears and either the title of the document or documents or the date of the oral proceedings to be incorporated. The parts of any record incorporated by reference must be identified in a separate section at the end of the designation of the record. (B) If the transcript incorporates by reference any such record, the cover of the transcript must prominently display the notice "Record in case number: ___ incorporated by reference," identifying the number of the case from which the record is incorporated. (C) On request of the reviewing court or any party, the designating party must provide a copy of the materials incorporated by reference to the reviewing court or another party or lend them as provided in rule 8.153. (2) A party wanting any parts of a clerk's transcript or other record of the written documents from a prior appeal in the same case to be copied into the clerk's transcript in a later appeal must specify those parts in its designation of the record as provided in (1). The estimated cost of copying these materials must be included in the clerk's estimate of the cost of preparing the transcript under rule 8.122(c)(1). On request of the trial court clerk, the designating party must provide a copy of or lend the materials to be copied to the clerk. The parts of any record from a prior appeal that are copied into a clerk's transcript under this rule must be placed in a separate section at the end of the transcript and identified in a separate section at the end of the indexes.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a)(1) provides broadly for a single record whenever there are multiple appeals "from the same judgment or a related order." Multiple appeals from the   same judgment   include all cases in which opposing parties, or multiple parties on the same side of the case, appeal from the judgment. Multiple appeals from a judgment   and a related order   include all cases in which one party appeals from the judgment and another party appeals from any appealable order arising from or related to the judgment, i.e., not only orders contemplated by rule 8.108 (e.g., denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict) but also, for example, posttrial orders granting or denying attorney fees. The purpose is to encourage, when practicable, the preparation of a single record for all appeals taken in the same case. In specifying that "only one   record   need be prepared," of course, the rule does not depart from the basic requirement that an   original   and at least one   copy   of the record be prepared.

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 8.817</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Service and filing  (a) Service  (1) Before filing any document, a party must serve, by any method permitted by the Code of Civil Procedure, one copy of the document on the attorney for each party separately represented, on each unrepresented party, and on any other person or entity when required by statute or rule. (2) The party must attach to the document presented for filing a proof of service showing service on each person or entity required to be served under (1). The proof must name each party represented by each attorney served.  (b) Filing  (1) A document is deemed filed on the date the clerk receives it. (2) Unless otherwise provided by these rules or other law, a filing is not timely unless the clerk receives the document before the time to file it expires. (3) A brief, a petition for rehearing, or an answer to a petition for rehearing is timely if the time to file it has not expired on the date of: (A) Its mailing by priority or express mail as shown on the postmark or the postal receipt; or (B) Its delivery to a common carrier promising overnight delivery as shown on the carrier's receipt. (4) The provisions of (3) do not apply to original proceedings. (5) If the clerk receives a document by mail from an inmate or a patient in a custodial institution after the period for filing the document has expired but the envelope shows that the document was mailed or delivered to custodial officials for mailing within the period for filing the document, the document is deemed timely. The clerk must retain in the case file the envelope in which the document was received.  (Subd (b) amended effective July 1, 2010.) Rule 8.817 amended effective July 1, 2010; adopted effective January 1, 2009.  Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a)(1) requires service "by any method permitted by the Code of Civil Procedure." The reference is to the several permissible methods of service provided in Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010-1020.   What Is Proof of Service?   (form APP-109-INFO) provides additional information about how to serve documents and how to provide proof of service.  Subdivision (b).   In general, to be filed on time, a document must be received by the clerk before the time for filing that document expires. There are, however, some limited exceptions to this general rule. For example, (5) provides that if the superior court clerk receives a document by mail from a custodial institution after the deadline for filing the document has expired but the envelope shows that the document was mailed or delivered to custodial officials for mailing before the deadline expired, the document is deemed timely. This provision reflects the "prison-delivery" exception articulated by the California Supreme Court in   In re Jordan  (1992) 4 Cal.4th 116 and   Silverbrand v. County of Los Angeles   (2009) 46 Cal.4th 106. Note that if a deadline runs from the date of filing, it runs from the date that the document is actually received and deemed filed under (b)(1); neither (b)(3) nor (b)(5) changes that date. Nor do these provisions extend the date of finality of an appellate opinion or any other deadline that is based on finality, such as the deadline for the court to modify its opinion or order rehearing. Subdivision (b)(5) is also not intended to limit a criminal defendant's appeal rights under the case law of constructive filing. (See, e.g.,   In re Benoit   (1973) 10 Cal.3d 72.)

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2021; previously amended effective January 31, 1997, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Notice of availability; parties' request  (1)   Local policy to be adopted and posted  Each trial court must adopt and post in the clerk's office a local policy enumerating the departments in which the services of official court reporters are normally available, and the departments in which the services of official court reporters are not normally available during regular court hours. If the services of official court reporters are normally available in a department only for certain types of matters, those matters must be identified in the policy. (2)   Publication of policy  The court must publish its policy in a newspaper if one is published in the county. Instead of publishing the policy, the court may: (A) Send each party a copy of the policy at least 10 days before any hearing is held in a case; or (B) Adopt the policy as a local rule. (3)   Requests for official court reporter for civil trials and notices to parties  Unless the court's policy states that all courtrooms normally have the services of official court reporters available for civil trials, the court must require that each party file a statement before the trial date indicating whether the party requests the presence of an official court reporter. If a party requests the presence of an official court reporter and it appears that none will be available, the clerk must notify the party of that fact as soon as possible before the trial. If the services of official court reporters are normally available in all courtrooms, the clerk must notify the parties to a civil trial as soon as possible if it appears that those services will not be available. (4)   Notice of nonavailability of court reporter for nontrial matters  If the services of an official court reporter will not be available during a hearing on law and motion or other nontrial matters in civil cases, that fact must be noted on the court's official calendar.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Party may procure reporter or request reporter if granted fee waiver  If the services of an official court reporter are not available for a hearing or trial in a civil case, a party may: (1) Arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter, whom the court must appoint unless there is good cause shown to refuse to do so. It is that party's responsibility to pay the reporter's fee for attendance at the proceedings, but the expense may be recoverable as part of the costs, as provided by law; or (2) If the party has been granted a fee waiver, request that the court provide an official reporter for attendance at the proceedings. The court must provide an official reporter if the party has been granted a fee waiver and if the court is not electronically recording the hearing or trial. (A) The request should be made by filing a   Request for Court Reporter by a Party with a Fee Waiver   (form FW-020). If the requesting party has not been granted a fee waiver, a completed   Request to Waive Court Fees   (form FW-001 or form FW-001-GC in guardianship or conservator cases) must be filed at the same time as the request for court reporter.

(b) Preserving the confidentiality of mediation communications  All complaint procedures and complaint proceedings must be designed and conducted in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of mediation communications, including but not limited to the confidentiality of any communications between the mediator and individual mediation participants or subgroups of mediation participants.  (Subd (b) amended effective July 1, 2009, effective date extended to January 1, 2010.)  (c) Confidentiality of complaint proceedings  All complaint proceedings must occur in private and must be kept confidential.

            <div class="rule-title">Sealed records  (a) Application  This rule applies to sealed records and records proposed to be sealed on appeal and in original proceedings, but does not apply to confidential records.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2014; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Record sealed by the trial court  If a record sealed by order of the trial court is part of the record on appeal or the supporting documents or other records accompanying a motion, petition for a writ of habeas corpus, other writ petition, or other filing in the reviewing court: (1) The sealed record must remain sealed unless the reviewing court orders otherwise under (e). Rule 8.45 governs the form and transmission of and access to sealed records. (2) The record on appeal or supporting documents filed in the reviewing court must also include: (A) The motion or application to seal filed in the trial court; (B) All documents filed in the trial court supporting or opposing the motion or application; and (C) The trial court order sealing the record.  (Subd (b) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2014; adopted as subd (c); previously amended effective January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2007.)  (c) Record not sealed by the trial court  A record filed or lodged publicly in the trial court and not ordered sealed by that court must not be filed under seal in the reviewing court.  (Subd (c) relettered effective January 1, 2014; adopted as subd (d).)  (d) Record not filed in the trial court; motion or application to file under seal  (1) A record not filed in the trial court may be filed under seal in the reviewing court only by order of the reviewing court; it must not be filed under seal solely by stipulation or agreement of the parties. (2) To obtain an order under (1), a party must serve and file a motion or application in the reviewing court, accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing. At the same time, the party must lodge the record under (3), unless good cause is shown not to lodge it. (3) To lodge a record, the party must transmit the record to the court in a secure manner that preserves the confidentiality of the record to be lodged. The record must be transmitted separately from the rest of a clerk's or reporter's transcript, appendix, supporting documents, or other records sent to the reviewing court with a cover sheet that complies with rule 8.40(b) if the record is in paper form or rule 8.74(a)(9) if the record is in electronic form, and that labels the contents as "CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL." If the record is in paper format, it must be placed in a sealed envelope or other appropriate sealed container. (4) If necessary to prevent disclosure of material contained in a conditionally sealed record, any motion or application, any opposition, and any supporting documents must be filed in a redacted version and lodged in a complete unredacted version conditionally under seal. The cover of the redacted version must identify it as "Public-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record." In juvenile cases, the cover of the redacted version must identify it as "Redacted version-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record." The cover of the unredacted version must identify it as "May Not Be Examined Without Court Order-Contains material from conditionally sealed record." Unless the court orders otherwise, any party that had access to the record in the trial court or other proceedings under review must be served with a complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a redacted version.

Unless otherwise provided by this rule or other law, rule 8.45 governs the form and transmission of and access to confidential records.  (b) Records of   Marsden   hearings and other in-camera proceedings  (1) This subdivision applies to reporter's transcripts of and documents filed or lodged by a defendant in connection with: (A) An in-camera hearing conducted by the superior court under   People v. Marsden   (1970) 2 Cal.3d 118; or (B) Another in-camera hearing at which the defendant was present but from which the People were excluded in order to prevent disclosure of information about defense strategy or other information to which the prosecution was not allowed access at the time of the hearing. (2) Except as provided in (3), if the defendant raises a   Marsden   issue or an issue related to another in-camera hearing covered by this rule in a brief, petition, or other filing in the reviewing court, the following procedures apply: (A) The brief, including any portion that discloses matters contained in the transcript of the in-camera hearing, and other documents filed or lodged in connection with the hearing, must be filed publicly. The requirement to publicly file this brief does not apply in juvenile cases; rule 8.401 governs the format of and access to such briefs in juvenile cases. (B) The People may serve and file an application requesting a copy of the reporter's transcript of, and documents filed or lodged by a defendant in connection with, the in-camera hearing. (C) Within 10 days after the application is filed, the defendant may serve and file opposition to this application on the basis that the transcript or documents contain confidential material not relevant to the issues raised by the defendant in the reviewing court. Any such opposition must identify the page and line numbers of the transcript or documents containing this irrelevant material. (D) If the defendant does not timely serve and file opposition to the application, the reviewing court clerk must send to the People a copy of the reporter's transcript of, and documents filed or lodged by a defendant in connection with, the in-camera hearing. (3) A defendant may serve and file a motion or application in the reviewing court requesting permission to file under seal a brief, petition, or other filing that raises a   Marsden   issue or an issue related to another in-camera hearing covered by this subdivision and requesting an order maintaining the confidentiality of the relevant material from the reporter's transcript of or documents filed or lodged in connection with the in-camera hearing. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, rule 8.46(d) governs a motion or application under this subdivision. (B) The declaration accompanying the motion or application must contain facts sufficient to justify an order maintaining the confidentiality of the relevant material from the reporter's transcript of, or documents filed or lodged in connection with, the in-camera hearing and sealing of the brief, petition, or other filing. (C) At the time the motion or application is filed, the defendant must: (i) File a public redacted version of the brief, petition, or other filing that he or she is requesting be filed under seal. The cover of this version must identify it as "Public-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record." The requirement to publicly file the redacted version does not apply in juvenile cases; rule 8.401 generally governs access to filings in juvenile cases. In juvenile cases, the cover of the redacted version must identify it as "Redacted version-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record."  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 8.63</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Policies and factors governing extensions of time  (a) Policies  (1) The time limits prescribed by these rules should generally be met to ensure expeditious conduct of appellate business and public confidence in the efficient administration of appellate justice. (2) The effective assistance of counsel to which a party is entitled includes adequate time for counsel to prepare briefs or other documents that fully advance the party's interests. Adequate time also allows the preparation of accurate, clear, concise, and complete submissions that assist the courts. (3) For a variety of legitimate reasons, counsel may not always be able to prepare briefs or other documents within the time specified in the rules of court. To balance the competing policies stated in (1) and (2), applications to extend time in the reviewing courts must demonstrate good cause--or an exceptional showing of good cause, when required by these rules--under (b). If good cause is shown, the court must extend the time.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Factors considered  In determining good cause--or an exceptional showing of good cause, when required by these rules--the court must consider the following factors when applicable: (1) The degree of prejudice, if any, to any party from a grant or denial of the extension. A party claiming prejudice must support the claim in detail. (2) In a civil case, the positions of the client and any opponent with regard to the extension. (3) The length of the record, including the number of relevant trial exhibits. A party relying on this factor must specify the length of the record. In a civil case, a record containing one volume of clerk's transcript or appendix and two volumes of reporter's transcript is considered an average-length record. (4) The number and complexity of the issues raised. A party relying on this factor must specify the issues. (5) Whether there are settlement negotiations and, if so, how far they have progressed and when they might be completed. (6) Whether the case is entitled to priority. (7) Whether counsel responsible for preparing the document is new to the case. (8) Whether other counsel or the client needs additional time to review the document. (9) Whether counsel responsible for preparing the document has other time-limited commitments that prevent timely filing of the document. Mere conclusory statements that more time is needed because of other pressing business will not suffice. Good cause requires a specific showing of other obligations of counsel that: (A) Have deadlines that as a practical matter preclude filing the document by the due date without impairing its quality; or (B) Arise from cases entitled to priority. (10) Illness of counsel, a personal emergency, or a planned vacation that counsel did not reasonably expect to conflict with the due date and cannot reasonably rearrange. (11) Any other factor that constitutes good cause in the context of the case.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)

            <div class="rule-title">Statement of purpose  (a) Intent  The rules in this article are intended to provide the public with reasonable access to appellate court records that are maintained in electronic form, while protecting privacy interests .  (b) Benefits of electronic access  Improved technologies provide courts with many alternatives to the historical paper-based record receipt and retention process, including the creation and use of court records maintained in electronic form. Providing public access to appellate court records that are maintained in electronic form may save the courts and the public time, money, and effort and encourage courts to be more efficient in their operations. Improved access to appellate court records may also foster in the public a more comprehensive understanding of the appellate court system.  (c) No creation of rights  The rules in this article are not intended to give the public a right of access to any record that they are not otherwise entitled to access. The rules do not create any right of access to sealed or confidential records.  Rule 8.80 adopted effective January 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  The rules in this article acknowledge the benefits that electronic court records provide but attempt to limit the potential for unjustified intrusions into the privacy of individuals involved in litigation that can occur as a result of remote access to electronic court records. The proposed rules take into account the limited resources currently available in the appellate courts. It is contemplated that the rules may be modified to provide greater electronic access as the courts' technical capabilities improve and with the knowledge gained from the experience of the courts in providing electronic access under these rules.  Subdivision (c).   Rules 8.45-8.47 govern sealed and confidential records in the appellate courts.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

(b) Notice regarding proceedings before referee  (1) In each case in which he or she is appointed, a referee must file a statement that provides the name, telephone number, e-mail address, and mailing address of a person who may be contacted to obtain information about the date, time, location, and general nature of all hearings scheduled in matters pending before the referee that would be open to the public if held before a judge.

(2) In addition to providing the information required under (1), the statement filed by a referee may also provide the address of a publicly accessible website at which the referee will maintain a current calendar setting forth the date, time, location, and general nature of any hearings scheduled in the matter that would be open to the public if held before a judge.

            <div class="rule-title">Excuses from jury service  (a) Duty of citizenship  Jury service, unless excused by law, is a responsibility of citizenship. The court and its staff must employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important civic responsibility.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Principles  The following principles govern the granting of excuses from jury service by the jury commissioner on grounds of undue hardship under Code of Civil Procedure section 204: (1) No class or category of persons may be automatically excluded from jury duty except as provided by law. (2) A statutory exemption from jury service must be granted only when the eligible person claims it. (3) Deferring jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror for a temporary or marginal hardship. (4) Inconvenience to a prospective juror or an employer is not an adequate reason to be excused from jury duty, although it may be considered a ground for deferral.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Requests to be excused from jury service  All requests to be excused from jury service that are granted for undue hardship must be put in writing by the prospective juror, reduced to writing, or placed on the court's record. The prospective juror must support the request with facts specifying the hardship and a statement why the circumstances constituting the undue hardship cannot be avoided by deferring the prospective juror's service.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Reasons for excusing a juror because of undue hardship  An excuse on the ground of undue hardship may be granted for any of the following reasons: (1) The prospective juror has no reasonably available means of public or private transportation to the court. (2) The prospective juror must travel an excessive distance. Unless otherwise established by statute or local rule, an excessive distance is reasonable travel time that exceeds one-and-one-half hours from the prospective juror's home to the court. (3) The prospective juror will bear an extreme financial burden. In determining whether to excuse the prospective juror for this reason, consideration must be given to: (A) The sources of the prospective juror's household income; (B) The availability and extent of income reimbursement; (C) The expected length of service; and (D) Whether service can reasonably be expected to compromise the prospective juror's ability to support himself or herself or his or her dependents, or so disrupt the economic stability of any individual as to be against the interests of justice. (4) The prospective juror will bear an undue risk of material injury to or destruction of the prospective juror's property or property entrusted to the prospective juror, and it is not feasible to make alternative arrangements to alleviate the risk. In determining whether to excuse the prospective juror for this reason, consideration must be given to: (A) The nature of the property;  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

            <div class="rule-title">Permanent medical excuse from jury service  (a) Definitions  As used in this rule: (1) "Applicant" means a "person with a disability" or their authorized representative. (2) "Authorized representative" means a conservator, agent under a power of attorney (attorney-in-fact), or any other individual designated by the person with a disability. (3) "Capable of performing jury service" means a person can pay attention to evidence, testimony, and other court proceedings for up to six hours per day, with a lunch break and short breaks in the morning and afternoon, with or without disability-related accommodations, including auxiliary aids and services. (4) "Health care provider" means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, podiatrist, dentist, chiropractor, clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, clinical social worker, therapist, physician's assistant, Christian Science Practitioner, or any other medical provider, facility, or organization that is authorized and performing within the scope of the practice of their profession in accordance with state or federal law and regulations. (5) "Permanent medical excuse" means a release from jury service granted by the jury commissioner to a person with a disability whose condition is unlikely to resolve and who, with or without disability-related accommodations, including auxiliary aids or services, is not capable of performing jury service. (6) "Person with a disability" means an individual covered by Civil Code section 51 et seq., the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.), or other applicable state and federal laws. This definition includes a person who has a physical or mental medical condition that limits one or more of the major life activities, has a record of such a condition, or is regarded as having such a condition.  (b) Policy  (1) This rule is intended to allow a person with a disability whose condition is unlikely to resolve and who is unable for the foreseeable future to serve as a juror to seek a permanent medical excuse from jury service. This rule does not impose limitations on or invalidate the remedies, rights, and procedures accorded to persons with disabilities under state or federal law. (2) It is the policy of the courts of this state to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system, including the opportunity to serve as jurors. No eligible jurors who can perform jury service, with or without disability-related accommodations, including auxiliary aids or services, may be excused from jury service due solely to their disability.  (c) Process for requesting permanent medical excuse  The process for requesting a permanent medical excuse from jury service is as follows: (1) An applicant must submit to the jury commissioner a written request for permanent medical excuse with a supporting letter, memo, or note from a treating health care provider. The supporting letter, memo, or note must be on the treating health care provider's letterhead, state that the person has a permanent disability that makes the person incapable of performing jury service, and be signed by the provider. (2) The applicant must submit the request and supporting letter, memo, or note to the jury commissioner on or before the date the person is required to appear for jury service. (3) In the case of an incomplete application, the jury commissioner may require the applicant to furnish additional information in support of the request for permanent medical excuse.

            <div class="rule-title">Tentative rulings  (a) Tentative ruling procedures  A trial court that offers a tentative ruling procedure in civil law and motion matters must follow one of the following procedures: (1)   Notice of intent to appear required  The court must make its tentative ruling available by a method designated by the court, by no later than 3:00 p.m. the court day before the scheduled hearing. If the court desires oral argument, the tentative ruling must so direct. The tentative ruling may also note any issues on which the court wishes the parties to provide further argument. If the court has not directed argument, oral argument must be permitted only if a party notifies all other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the party’s intention to appear. A party must notify all other parties by telephone or in person. The court must accept notice by telephone and, at its discretion, may also designate alternative methods by which a party may notify the court of the party’s intention to appear. The tentative ruling will become the ruling of the court if the court has not directed oral argument by its tentative ruling and notice of intent to appear has not been given. (2)   No notice of intent to appear required  The court must make its tentative ruling available by a method designated by the court, by a specified time before the hearing. The tentative ruling may note any issues on which the court wishes the parties to provide further argument at the hearing. This procedure must not require the parties to give notice of intent to appear, and the tentative ruling will not automatically become the ruling of the court if such notice is not given. The tentative ruling, or such other ruling as the court may render, will not become the final ruling of the court until the hearing.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2025; previously amended effective July 1, 2000, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) No other procedures permitted  Other than following one of the tentative ruling procedures authorized in (a), courts must not issue tentative rulings except: (1) By posting a calendar note containing tentative rulings on the day of the hearing; or (2) By announcing the tentative ruling at the time of oral argument.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously repealed and adopted effective July 1, 2000.)  (c) Notice of procedure  A court that follows one of the procedures described in (a) must so state in its local rules.

            <div class="rule-title">Calendar preference  A party seeking calendar preference must promptly serve and file a motion for preference in the reviewing court. As used in this rule, "calendar preference" means an expedited appeal schedule, which may include expedited briefing and preference in setting the date of oral argument.  Rule 8.240 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; repealed and adopted as rule 19 effective January 1, 2003.  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 8.240 requires a party claiming preference to file a motion for preference in the reviewing court. The motion requirement relieves the reviewing court of the burden of searching the record to determine if preference should be ordered. The requirement is not intended to bar the court from ordering preference without a motion when the ground is apparent on the face of the appeal, e.g., in appeals from judgments of dependency (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 395). The rule is broad in scope: it includes motions for preference on the grounds (1) that a statute provides for preference in the reviewing court (e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 44 [probate proceedings, contested elections, libel by public official), 45 [judgment freeing minor from parental custody]); (2) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference when a statute provides for trial preference (e.g., id., §§ 35 [certain election matters], 36 [party over 70 and in poor health; party with terminal illness; minor in wrongful death action]; see Warren v. Schecter (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1198-1199); and (3) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference on a nonstatutory ground (e.g., economic hardship). Because valid grounds for preference could arise after the filing of the reply brief, e.g., a diagnosis of terminal illness, the rule requires the motion to be filed "promptly," i.e., as soon as the ground for preference arises.

            <div class="rule-title">Settlement, abandonment, voluntary dismissal, and compromise  (a) Notice of settlement  (1) If a civil case settles after a notice of appeal has been filed either as a whole or as to any party, the appellant who has settled must immediately serve and file a notice of settlement in the Court of Appeal. If the parties have designated a clerk's or a reporter's transcript and the record has not been filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant must also immediately serve a copy of the notice on the superior court clerk. (2) If the case settles after the appellant receives a notice setting oral argument or a prehearing conference, the appellant must also immediately notify the Court of Appeal of the settlement by telephone or other expeditious method. (3) Within 45 days after filing a notice of settlement-unless the court has ordered a longer time period on a showing of good cause-the appellant who filed the notice of settlement must file either an abandonment under (b), if the record has not yet been filed in the Court of Appeal, or a request to dismiss under (c), if the record has already been filed in the Court of Appeal. (4) If the appellant does not file an abandonment, a request to dismiss, or a letter stating good cause why the appeal should not be dismissed within the time period specified under (3), the court may dismiss the appeal as to that appellant and order each side to bear its own costs on appeal. (5) This subdivision does not apply to settlements requiring findings to be made by the Court of Appeal under Code of Civil Procedure section 128(a)(8).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.)  (b) Abandonment  (1) Before the record is filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant may serve and file in superior court an abandonment of the appeal or a stipulation to abandon the appeal. The filing effects a dismissal of the appeal and restores the superior court's jurisdiction. (2) The superior court clerk must promptly notify the Court of Appeal and the parties of the abandonment or stipulation.  (c) Request to dismiss  (1) After the record is filed in the Court of Appeal, the appellant may serve and file in that court a request or a stipulation to dismiss the appeal. (2) On receipt of a request or stipulation to dismiss, the court may dismiss the appeal and direct immediate issuance of the remittitur.  (d) Approval of compromise  If a guardian or conservator seeks approval of a proposed compromise of a pending appeal, the Court of Appeal may, before ruling on the compromise, direct the trial court to determine whether the compromise is in the minor's or the conservatee's best interests and to report its findings.

(2) A Court of Appeal may hold sessions at places in its district other than the court's permanent location. (3) Subject to approval by the Chair of the Judicial Council, a Court of Appeal may hold a session in another district to hear a cause transferred to it from that district.  (b) Notice of argument  The clerk/executive officer of the Court of Appeal must send a notice of the time and place of oral argument to all parties at least 20 days before the argument date. The presiding justice may shorten the notice period for good cause; in that event, the clerk/executive officer must immediately notify the parties by telephone or other expeditious method.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (c) Conduct of argument  Unless the court provides otherwise by local rule or order: (1) The appellant, petitioner, or moving party has the right to open and close. If there are two or more such parties, the court must set the sequence of argument. (2) Each side is allowed 30 minutes for argument.

(3) Only one counsel may argue for each separately represented party.  (d) When the cause is submitted  (1) A cause is submitted when the court has heard oral argument or approved its waiver and the time has expired to file all briefs and papers, including any supplemental brief permitted by the court. (2) If the Supreme Court transfers a cause to the Court of Appeal and supplemental briefs may be filed under rule 8.200(b), the cause is submitted when the last such brief is or could be timely filed. The Court of Appeal may order the cause submitted at an earlier time if the parties so stipulate.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Vacating submission  (1) Except as provided in (2), the court may vacate submission only by an order stating its reasons and setting a timetable for resubmission. (2) If a cause is submitted under (d)(2), an order setting oral argument vacates submission and the cause is resubmitted when the court has heard oral argument or approved its waiver.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Sound recording only  The following specifications for electronic recording devices and appurtenant equipment apply when only sound is to be recorded: (1)   Mandatory specifications  (A) The device must be capable of simultaneously recording at least four separate channels or "tracks," each of which has a separate playback control so that any one channel separately or any combination of channels may be played back.

(c) Preliminary review and disposition of complaints  The complaint coordinator must conduct a preliminary review of all complaints to determine whether the complaint can be informally resolved or closed, or whether the complaint warrants investigation.  (d) Procedure for complaints not resolved through the preliminary review  The following procedures are required only if a complaint is not resolved or closed through the preliminary review. (1)   Mediator's notice and opportunity to respond  The mediator must be given notice of the complaint and an opportunity to respond. (2)   Investigation and recommendation  (A) Except as provided in (B), the complaint must be investigated and a recommendation concerning court action on the complaint must be made by either an individual who has experience as a mediator and who is familiar with the rules of conduct stated in article 2 or a complaint committee that has at least one such individual as a member. (B) A court with eight or fewer authorized judges may waive the requirement in (A) for participation by an individual who has experience as a mediator in conducting the investigation and making the recommendation if the court cannot find a suitable qualified individual to perform the functions described in (A) or for other grounds of hardship. (3)   Final decision  The final decision on the complaint must be made by the presiding judge or his or her designee, who must not be the complaint coordinator or an individual who investigated the complaint before its submission for final decision.

            <div class="rule-title">Pretrial procedures for mandatory expedited jury trials  (a) Pretrial procedures  The pretrial procedures for limited civil actions set out in Code of Civil Procedure sections 90-100 are applicable to all cases with mandatory expedited jury trials. The statutory procedures include limited discovery, optional case questionnaires, optional requests for pretrial statements identifying trial witnesses and exhibits, and the possibility of presenting testimony in the form of affidavits or declarations.  (b) Case management  The case management rules in chapter 3 of division 7 of these rules, starting at rule 3.720, are applicable to all cases with mandatory expedited jury trials, except to the extent the rules have been modified by local court rules applicable to limited civil cases.  (c) Opting out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures  (1) Parties seeking to opt out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures on grounds stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 630.20(b) must file a   Request to Opt Out of Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures   (form EJT-003). (2) Except on a showing of good cause, the request to opt out must be served and filed at least 45 days before the date first set for trial or, in cases in which the date first set for trial occurred before July 1, 2016, 45 days before the first trial date after July 1, 2016. (3) Except on a showing of good cause, any objection to the request must be served and filed within 15 days after the date of service of the request, on an   Objection to Request to Opt Out of Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures   (form EJT- 004). (4) If the grounds on which a party or parties have opted out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures no longer apply to a case, the parties must promptly inform the court, and the case may be tried as a mandatory expedited jury trial.  (Subd (c) amended effective September 1, 2017.)  (d) Agreements regarding pretrial and trial procedures  Parties are encouraged to agree to procedures or limitations on pretrial procedures and on presentation of information at trial that could streamline the case, including but not limited to those items described in rule 3.1547(b). The parties may use  Agreement of Parties (Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures)   (form EJT-018) and the attachment (form EJT-022A) to describe such agreements.  Rule 3.1546 amended effective September 1, 2017; adopted effective July 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  Because Code of Civil Procedure section 630.20, which becomes operative July 1, 2016, applies to cases already on file and possibly already set for trial, as well as cases filed after the statutory provisions go into effect, the deadlines in rule 3.1546(c) for opt outs and objections may be problematic as applied to cases set for trial within the first couple of months after the rule goes into effect. It is expected that the good cause provisions within the rules regarding deadlines, along with judicious use of continuances as appropriate, will be liberally used to permit courts to manage those cases fairly, appropriately, and efficiently.

            <div class="rule-title">Filing, finality, and modification of decision  (a) Filing the decision  The clerk/executive officer of the Supreme Court must promptly file all opinions and orders issued by the court and promptly send copies showing the filing date to the parties and, when relevant, to the lower court or tribunal.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Finality of decision  (1) Except as provided in (2), a Supreme Court decision is final 30 days after filing unless: (A) The court orders a shorter period; or (B) Before the 30-day period or any extension expires the court orders one or more extensions, not to exceed a total of 60 additional days. (2) The following Supreme Court decisions are final on filing: (A) The denial of a petition for review of a Court of Appeal decision; (B) A disposition ordered under rule 8.528(b), (d), or (e); (C) The denial of a petition for a writ within the court's original jurisdiction without issuance of an alternative writ or order to show cause; and (D) The denial of a petition for writ of supersedeas.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Modification of decision  The Supreme Court may modify a decision as provided in rule 8.264(c).  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.) Rule 8.532 amended effective January 1, 2018; repealed and adopted as rule 29.4 effective January 1, 2003; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b).   Subdivision (b)(2)(A) recognizes the general rule that the denial of a petition for review of a Court of Appeal decision is final on filing. Subdivision (b)(2)(B)-(D) recognizes several additional types of Supreme Court decisions that are final on filing. Thus (b)(2)(B) recognizes that a dismissal, a transfer, and a retransfer under (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of rule 8.528 are decisions final on filing. A remand under rule 8.528(c) is not a decision final on filing because it is not a separately filed order; rather, as part of its appellate judgment at the end of its opinion in such cases the Supreme Court simply orders the cause remanded to the Court of Appeal for disposition of the remaining issues in the appeal. Subdivision (b)(2)(C) recognizes that an order denying a petition for a writ within the court's original jurisdiction without issuance of an alternative writ or order to show cause is final on filing. The provision reflects the settled Supreme Court practice, since at least 1989, of declining to file petitions for rehearing in such matters. (See, e.g.,   In re Hayes   (S004421) Minutes, Cal. Supreme Ct., July 28, 1989 ["The motion to vacate this court's order of May 18, 1989 [denying a petition for habeas corpus without opinion] is denied. Because the California Rules of Court do not authorize the filing of a petition for rehearing of such an order, the alternate request to consider the matter as a petition for rehearing is denied."].) Subdivision (b)(2)(D) recognizes that an order denying a petition for writ of supersedeas is final on filing.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

(3) If necessary to prevent mootness or frustration of the relief granted or to otherwise promote the interests of justice, the court may order early finality in that court of a decision granting a petition for a writ under this chapter or, except as provided in (1), a decision denying such a petition. The decision may provide for finality in that court on filing or within a stated period of less than 30 days. (4) If a Court of Appeal certifies its opinion for publication or partial publication after filing its decision and before its decision becomes final in that court, the finality period runs from the filing date of the order for publication. (5) If an order modifying an opinion changes the appellate judgment, the finality period runs from the filing date of the modification order.

            <div class="rule-title">Briefs by parties and amici curiae  (a) Briefs by parties  (1) The appellant must serve and file an appellant's opening brief within: (A) 30 days after the record-or the reporter's transcript, after a rule 8.845 election in a civil case-is filed in the appellate division; or (B) 60 days after the filing of a rule 8.845 election in a civil case, if the appeal proceeds without a reporter's transcript. (2) Any respondent's brief must be served and filed within 30 days after the appellant files its opening brief. (3) Any appellant's reply brief must be served and filed within 20 days after the respondent files its brief. (4) No other brief may be filed except with the permission of the presiding judge. (5) Instead of filing a brief, or as part of its brief, a party may join in a brief or adopt by reference all or part of a brief in the same or a related appeal.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2021.)  (b) Extensions of time  (1) Except as otherwise provided by statute, in a civil case, the parties may extend each period under (a) by up to 30 days by filing one or more stipulations in the appellate division before the brief is due. Stipulations must be signed by and served on all parties. If the stipulation is filed in paper form, the original signature of at least one party must appear on the stipulation filed in the appellate division; the signatures of the other parties may be in the form of fax copies of the signed signature page of the stipulation. If the stipulation is electronically filed, the signatures must comply with the requirements of rule 8.77. (2) A stipulation under (1) is effective on filing. The appellate division may not shorten such a stipulated extension. (3) Before the brief is due, a party may apply to the presiding judge of the appellate division for an extension of the time period for filing a brief under (a). The application must show that there is good cause to grant an extension under rule 8.811(b). In civil appeals, the application must also show that: (A) The applicant was unable to obtain-or it would have been futile to seek-the extension by stipulation; or (B) The parties have stipulated to the maximum extension permitted under (1) and the applicant seeks a further extension. (4) A party need not apply for an extension or relief from default if it can file its brief within the time prescribed by (c). The clerk must file a brief submitted within that time if it otherwise complies with these rules.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2009; previously amended effective January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2013.)  (c) Failure to file a brief  (1) If a party in a civil appeal fails to timely file an appellant's opening brief or a respondent's brief, the appellate division clerk must promptly notify the party in writing that the brief must be filed within 15 days after the notice is sent and that if the party fails to comply, the court may impose one of the following sanctions: (A) If the brief is an appellant's opening brief, the court may dismiss the appeal; or (B) If the brief is a respondent's brief, the court may decide the appeal on the record, the appellant's opening brief, and any oral argument by the appellant.

(b) Transcripts from official electronic recording  Written transcripts of official electronic recordings may be prepared under rule 2.952.

(c) Use of official recording as record of oral proceedings  If the court has a local rule for the appellate division permitting this, on stipulation of the parties or on order of the trial court under rule 8.916(d)(6), the original of an official electronic recording of the trial court proceedings, or a copy made by the court, may be transmitted as the record of these oral proceedings without being transcribed. This official electronic recording satisfies any requirement in these rules or in any statute for a reporter's transcript of these proceedings.  (Subd (c) amended effective July 1, 2010.)  (d) Contents  Except in appeals when either the parties have filed a stipulation under rule 8.910(b) or the trial court has ordered that any of these items is not required for proper determination of the appeal, rules 8.918 and 8.920 govern the contents of a transcript of an official electronic recording.

            <div class="rule-title">Notice of intent to file writ petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.28 to review order designating specific placement of a dependent child after termination of parental rights  (a) Application  Rules 8.454-8.456 and 8.490 govern writ petitions to review placement orders following termination of parental rights entered on or after January 1, 2005. "Posttermination placement order" as used in this rule and rule 8.456 refers to orders following termination of parental rights.  (Subd (a) amended effective July 1, 2010; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2009.)  (b) Purpose  The purpose of this rule is to facilitate and implement Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.28. Delays caused by appeals from court orders designating the specific placement of a dependent child after parental rights have been terminated may cause a substantial detriment to the child.  (c) Who may file  The petitioner's trial counsel, or, in the absence of trial counsel, the party, is responsible for filing any notice of intent and writ petition under rules 8.454-8.456. Trial counsel is encouraged to seek assistance from, or consult with, attorneys experienced in writ procedure.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2008; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Extensions of time  The superior court may not extend any time period prescribed by rules 8.454-8.456. The reviewing court may extend any time period, but must require an exceptional showing of good cause.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Notice of intent  (1) A party seeking writ review under rules 8.454-8.456 must file in the superior court a notice of intent to file a writ petition and a request for the record. (2) The notice must include all known dates of the hearing that resulted in the order under review. (3) The notice must be authorized by the party intending to file the petition and signed by the party or by the attorney of record for that party. (4) The notice must be served and filed within 7 days after the date of the posttermination placement order or, if the order was made by a referee not acting as a temporary judge, within 7 days after the referee's order becomes final under rule 5.540(c). The date of the posttermination placement order is the date on which the court states the order on the record orally or in writing, whichever first occurs. (5) If the party was notified of the posttermination placement order only by mail, the notice of intent must be filed within 12 days after the date that the clerk mailed the notification.  (Subd (e) amended effective July 1, 2010; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (f) Premature or late notice of intent to file writ petition  (1) A notice of intent to file a writ petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.28 is premature if filed before a date for a posttermination placement order has been made. The reviewing court may treat the notice as filed immediately after the posttermination order has been made.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

The professional in charge of the facility must submit a written evaluation of the child to the court.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Findings regarding a mental disorder (§ 6551)  Article 1 of chapter 2 of part 1 of division 5 (commencing with section 5150) applies. (1) If the professional reports that the child is not in need of intensive treatment, the child must be returned to the juvenile court on or before the expiration of the 72-hour period, and the court must proceed with the case under section 300, 601, or 602. (2) If the professional in charge of the facility finds that the child is in need of intensive treatment for a mental disorder, the child may be certified for not more than 14 days of involuntary intensive treatment according to the conditions of sections 5250(c) and 5260(b). The stay of the juvenile court proceedings must remain in effect during this time. (A) During or at the end of the 14 days of involuntary intensive treatment, a certification may be sought for additional treatment under sections commencing with 5270.10 or for the initiation of proceedings to have a conservator appointed for the child under sections commencing with 5350. The juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over the child during proceedings under sections 5270.10 et seq. and 5350 et seq. (B) For a child subject to a petition under section 602, if the child is found to be gravely disabled under sections 5300 et seq., a conservator is appointed under those sections, and the professional in charge of the child's treatment or of the treatment facility determines that proceedings under section 602 would be detrimental to the child, the juvenile court must suspend jurisdiction while the conservatorship remains in effect. The suspension of jurisdiction may end when the conservatorship is terminated, and the original 602 matter may be calendared for further proceedings.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)

(1) If the professional finds that the child has a developmental disability and recommends commitment to a state hospital, the court may direct the filing in the appropriate court of a petition for commitment of a child who has a developmental disability to the State Department of Developmental Services for placement in a state hospital. (2) If the professional finds that the child does not have a developmental disability, the child must be returned to the juvenile court on or before the expiration of the 72-hour period, and the court must proceed with the case under section 300, 601, or 602.

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 1.300</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Access to programs, services, and professionals  (a) Definitions  As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, the following definitions apply: (1) "Court-provided programs, services, and professionals" are services offered and provided by court employees or by contractors or vendors under agreement with the court. (2) "Court litigant" is a person who is a party in a court case or other legal proceeding. (3) "Language services" are services designed to provide access to the legal system to limited English proficient court litigants and may include in-person interpretation, telephonic interpreter services, video remote interpreting services, and services provided by assigned bilingual employees and bilingual volunteers. (4) "Limited English proficient" describes a person who speaks English "less than very well" and who, as a result, cannot understand or participate in a court proceeding. (5) "Private programs, services, and professionals" are services provided by outside agencies, organizations, and persons that court litigants may be required to access by court order.  (b) Provision of language services in court-ordered and court-provided programs, services, and professionals  As soon as feasible, each court must adopt procedures to enable limited English proficient court litigants to access court- ordered and court-provided programs, services, and professionals to the same extent as persons who are proficient in English.  (c) Provision of language services in private programs and services, and by private professionals  To the extent feasible, a court should avoid ordering a limited English proficient court litigant to a private program, service, or professional that is not language accessible.  (d) Delay in access to services  If a limited English proficient court litigant is unable to access a private program, service, or professional within the time period ordered by the court due to limitations in language service availability, the court litigant may submit a statement to the court indicating the reason for the delay, and the court may, for good cause, enter an alternative order or extend the time for completion. Court litigants may use   Service Not Available in My Language: Request to Change Court Order   (form LA- 400) for this purpose. The court may respond to the request using   Service Not Available in My Language: Order   (form LA-450).  (e) Use of technology  Courts should seek out opportunities to collaborate with each other and with community partners in the provision of language services, and should employ technology to promote the sharing of bilingual staff and certified and registered court interpreters among courts, as appropriate.  Rule 1.300 adopted effective September 1, 2019.  Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b).   The goal of this rule is to connect limited English proficient court litigants ordered by courts to access programs or professionals with services in the languages spoken by the litigants. Recognizing that not all program providers will be willing or able to meet the language needs, the rule is intended to help courts become aware of those language services available in the community so that limited English proficient court litigants are not placed in a position where they are unable to comply with court orders because the required services are not available in a language they understand. To facilitate equal access to justice, when courts order limited English proficient litigants to access court-provided programs, services, and professionals, to the greatest extent possible, courts should ensure that the services are language accessible.

The rule applies to presumptive transfer following any change of placement within California for a child or nonminor to a placement that is outside the county of original jurisdiction, including the initial placement. Nothing in this rule relieves the placing agency of the reporting requirements and duties under section 14717.1 when no hearing under this rule is held.  (b) Requesting a hearing to review the request for waiver of presumptive transfer (§ 14717.1)  (1) The following persons or agencies may make a request to the placing agency that presumptive transfer be waived and that the responsibility for providing specialty mental health services remain in the child's or nonminor's county of original jurisdiction: (A) The foster child or nonminor; (B) The person or agency that is responsible for making mental health care decisions on behalf of the foster child or nonminor; (C) The child welfare services agency or the probation agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child or nonminor; and (D) Any other interested party who owes a legal duty to the child or nonminor involving the child's or nonminor's health or welfare, as defined by the department. (2) The person or agency who requested the waiver, or any other party to the case who disagrees with the placing agency's determination on the request for the waiver of presumptive transfer, may request a judicial review of the placing agency's determination. (3) A request for a hearing must be made by filing a   Request for Hearing on Waiver of Presumptive Transfer   (form JV-214). If a hearing is requested, form JV-214 must be provided to the placing agency within seven court days of the petitioner's being noticed of the placing agency's determination on the request for waiver of presumptive transfer. (4) When a hearing is requested in (b)(3), the transfer of the responsibility for providing specialty mental health services cannot occur until the court makes a ruling as required in (c)(1).  (c) Setting of a hearing (§ 14717.1)  (1) The court on its own motion may direct the clerk to set a hearing no later than five court days after the request for a hearing was filed, or may deny the request for a hearing without ruling on the transfer of jurisdiction. (2) If the court sets a hearing, the clerk must provide notice of the hearing date to: (A) The parents-unless parental rights have been terminated-or guardians of the child; (B) The petitioner; (C) The social worker or probation officer; (D) The mental health care decision maker for the child or nonminor, if one has been appointed under section 361(a) (1); (E) The Indian child's tribe, if applicable, as defined in rule 5.502; (F) The child-if 10 years of age or older-or nonminor; and (G) All other persons entitled to notice under section 293 or section 727.4(a).

            <div class="rule-title">Right to make educational or developmental-services decisions  The court must identify the educational rights holder for the child at each hearing in a juvenile dependency or juvenile justice proceeding. At any hearing, where the court limits, restores, or modifies educational rights, or where there are updates to any contact or other information, in any juvenile proceeding, the findings and orders must be documented on form JV-535. Unless the rights of the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian have been limited by the court under this rule, the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian holds the educational and developmental-services decisionmaking rights for the child. In addition, a nonminor or nonminor dependent youth holds the rights to mae educational and developmental-services decisions for the youth and should be identified on form JV-535, unless rule 5.650(b) applies.  (a) Order (§§ 361, 366, 366.27, 366.3, 726, 727.2; 20 U.S.C. § 1415; 34 C.F.R. § 300.300)  At the dispositional hearing and each subsequent review or permanency hearing, the court must determine whether the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child should be limited. If necessary to protect a child who is adjudged a dependent or ward of the court under section 300, 601, or 602, the court may limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child by making appropriate, specific orders on   Order Designating Educational Rights Holder   (form JV-535).  (Subd (a) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (b) Temporary order (§ 319)  At the initial hearing on a petition filed under section 325 or at any time before a child is adjudged a dependent or the petition is dismissed, the court may, on making the findings required by section 319(g)(1), use form JV-535 to temporarily limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child. An order made under section 319(g) expires on dismissal of the petition, but in no circumstances later than the conclusion of the hearing held under section 361. If the court does temporarily limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions, the court must, at the dispositional hearing, reconsider the need to limit those rights and must identify the authorized educational rights holder on form JV-535.  (Subd (b) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (c) No delay of initial assessment  The child's initial assessment to determine any need for special education or developmental services need not be delayed to obtain parental or guardian consent or for the appointment of an educational rights holder if one or more of the following circumstances is met: (1) The court has limited, even temporarily, the educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights of the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian, and consent for an initial assessment has been given by an individual appointed by the court to represent the child; (2) The local educational agency or regional center, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian; or (3) Parental rights have been terminated or the guardianship has been set aside.  (Subd (c) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (d) Judicial Determination  If the court determines that the child is in need of any assessments, evaluations, or services-including special education, mental health, developmental, and other related services-the court must direct an appropriate person to take the necessary steps to request those assessments, evaluations, or services.

(2) The effective assistance of counsel to which a party is entitled includes adequate time for counsel to prepare briefs or other documents that fully advance the party's interests. Adequate time also allows the preparation of accurate, clear, concise, and complete submissions that assist the courts. (3) For a variety of legitimate reasons, counsel or self-represented litigants may not always be able to prepare briefs or other documents within the time specified in the rules of court. To balance the competing policies stated in (1) and (2), applications to extend time in the appellate division must demonstrate good cause under (b). If good cause is shown, the court must extend the time.  (b) Factors considered  In determining good cause, the court must consider the following factors when applicable: (1) The degree of prejudice, if any, to any party from a grant or denial of the extension. A party claiming prejudice must support the claim in detail. (2) In a civil case, the positions of the client and any opponent with regard to the extension. (3) The length of the record, including the number of relevant trial exhibits. A party relying on this factor must specify the length of the record. (4) The number and complexity of the issues raised. A party relying on this factor must specify the issues. (5) Whether there are settlement negotiations and, if so, how far they have progressed and when they might be completed. (6) Whether the case is entitled to priority. (7) Whether counsel responsible for preparing the document is new to the case. (8) Whether other counsel or the client needs additional time to review the document. (9) Whether counsel or a self-represented party responsible for preparing the document has other time-limited commitments that prevent timely filing of the document. Mere conclusory statements that more time is needed because of other pressing business will not suffice. Good cause requires a specific showing of other obligations of counsel or a self-represented party that: (A) Have deadlines that as a practical matter preclude filing the document by the due date without impairing its quality; or (B) Arise from cases entitled to priority. (10) Illness of counsel or a self-represented party, a personal emergency, or a planned vacation that counsel or a self- represented party did not reasonably expect to conflict with the due date and cannot reasonably rearrange. (11) Any other factor that constitutes good cause in the context of the case.  Rule 8.811 adopted effective January 1, 2009.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2003; previously amended effective July 1, 2001.)  (b) Authority of a court clerk to grant a request to attend traffic violator school  (1)   Eligible offenses  Except as provided in (2), a court clerk is authorized to grant a request to attend traffic violator school when a defendant with a valid driver's license requests to attend an 8-hour traffic violator school under Vehicle Code sections 41501(a) and 42005 for any infraction under divisions 11 and 12 (rules of the road and equipment violations) of the Vehicle Code if the violation is reportable to the Department of Motor Vehicles. (2)   Ineligible offenses  A court clerk is not authorized to grant a request to attend traffic violator school for a misdemeanor or any of the following infractions: (A) A violation that carries a negligent operator point count of more than one point under Vehicle Code section 12810 or one and one-half points or more under Vehicle Code section 12810.5(b)(2); (B) A violation that occurs within 18 months after the date of a previous violation and the defendant either attended or elected to attend a traffic violator school for the previous violation (Veh.

The record of conviction after completion of traffic violator school by a driver who holds a class A, class B, or commercial class C license must not be reported as confidential. A defendant charged with a violation that occurs in a commercial vehicle, as defined in Vehicle Code section 15210(b), is not eligible to attend traffic violator school under Vehicle Code sections 41501 or 42005 in lieu of adjudicating an offense, to receive a confidential conviction, or to avoid violator point counts.

            <div class="rule-title">Failure to appear or failure to pay for a Notice to Appear issued for an infraction offense  (a) Application  This rule applies to infraction offenses for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear and has failed to appear or failed to pay.  (b) Definitions  As used in this rule, "failure to appear" and "failure to pay" mean failure to appear and failure to pay as defined in section 1214.1(a).  (c) Procedure for consideration of good cause for failure to appear or pay  (1) A notice of a civil assessment under section 1214.1(b) must inform the defendant of his or her right to petition that the civil assessment be vacated for good cause and must include information about the process for vacating or reducing the assessment. (2) When a notice of civil assessment is given, a defendant may, within the time specified in the notice, move by written petition to vacate or reduce the assessment. (3) When a court imposes a civil assessment for failure to appear or pay, the defendant may petition that the court vacate or reduce the civil assessment without paying any bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments. (4) A petition to vacate an assessment does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessment unless specifically ordered by the court. (5) The court must vacate the assessment upon a showing of good cause under section 1214.1(b)(1) for failure to appear or failure to pay. (6) If the defendant does not establish good cause, the court may still exercise its discretion under section 1214.1(a) to reconsider: (A) Whether a civil assessment should be imposed; and (B) If so, the amount of the assessment. (7) In exercising its discretion, the court may consider such factors as a defendant's due diligence in appearing or paying after notice of the assessment has been given under section 1214.1(b)(1) and the defendant's financial circumstances.  (d) Procedure for unpaid bail referred to collection as delinquent debt in unadjudicated cases  (1) When a case has not been adjudicated and a court refers it to a comprehensive collection program as provided in section 1463.007(b)(1) as delinquent debt, the defendant may schedule a hearing for adjudication of the underlying charge(s) without payment of the bail amount. (2) The defendant may request an appearance date to adjudicate the underlying charges by written petition or alternative method provided by the court. Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance. (3) A court may require a deposit of bail before adjudication of the underlying charges if the court finds that the defendant is unlikely to appear as ordered without a deposit of bail and the court expressly states the reasons for the finding. The court must not require payment of the civil assessment before adjudication.  (e) Procedure for failure to pay or make a payment under an installment payment plan  (1) When a defendant fails to pay a fine or make a payment under an installment plan as provided in section 1205 or Vehicle Code sections 40510.5, 42003, or 42007, the court must permit the defendant to appear by written petition to modify the payment terms. Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

(4) The failure to receive a reminder notice does not relieve the defendant of the obligation to appear by the date stated in the   Notice to Appear .  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2025.)  (b) Minimum information in reminder notice  In addition to information obtained from the   Notice to Appear , the reminder notice must contain at least the following information: (1) An appearance date and location; (2) Whether a court appearance is mandatory or optional; (3) The total bail amount and payment options; including procedures for requesting installment plans, community service, and an ability-to-pay determination; (4) The notice about traffic school required under Vehicle Code section 42007, if applicable; (5) Notice that a traffic violator school will charge a fee in addition to the administrative fee charged by the court, if applicable; (6) The potential consequences for failure to appear, including a civil assessment of up to $100, a new charge for failure to appear, a warrant of arrest, or some combination of these consequences, if applicable; (7) Contact information for the court, including the court's website; (8) Information regarding trial by declaration, informal trial (if available), and telephone or website scheduling options (if available); and (9) Correction requirements and procedures for correctable violations.

            <div class="rule-title">Firearm relinquishment procedures for criminal protective orders  (a) Application of rule  This rule applies when a court issues a criminal protective order under Penal Code section 136.2 during a criminal case or as a condition of probation under Penal Code section 1203.097(a)(2) against a defendant charged with a crime of domestic violence as defined in Penal Code section 13700 and Family Code section 6211.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 22, 2019.)  (b) Purpose  This rule is intended to: (1) Assist courts issuing criminal protective orders to determine whether a defendant subject to such an order owns, possesses, or controls any firearms; and (2) Assist courts that have issued criminal protective orders to determine whether a defendant has complied with the court's order to relinquish or sell the firearms under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9.  (c) Setting review hearing  (1) At any hearing where the court issues a criminal protective order, the court must consider all credible information, including information provided on behalf of the defendant, to determine if there is good cause to believe that the defendant has a firearm within his or her immediate possession or control. (2) If the court finds good cause to believe that the defendant has a firearm within his or her immediate possession or control, the court must set a review hearing to ascertain whether the defendant has complied with the requirement to relinquish the firearm as specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9. Unless the defendant is in custody at the time, the review hearing should occur within two court days after issuance of the criminal protective order. If circumstances warrant, the court may extend the review hearing to occur within 5 court days after issuance of the criminal protective order. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to present information at the review hearing to refute the allegation that he or she owns any firearms. If the defendant is in custody at the time the criminal protective order is issued, the court should order the defendant to appear for a review hearing within two court days after the defendant's release from custody. (3) If the proceeding is held under Penal Code section 136.2, the court may, under Penal Code section 977(a)(2), order the defendant to personally appear at the review hearing. If the proceeding is held under Penal Code section 1203.097, the court should order the defendant to personally appear.  (d) Review hearing  (1) If the court has issued a criminal protective order under Penal Code section 136.2, at the review hearing: (A) If the court finds that the defendant has a firearm in or subject to his or her immediate possession or control, the court must consider whether bail, as set, or defendant's release on own recognizance is appropriate. (B) If the defendant does not appear at the hearing and the court orders that bail be revoked, the court should issue a bench warrant. (2) If the criminal protective order is issued as a condition of probation under Penal Code section 1203.097, and the court finds at the review hearing that the defendant has a firearm in or subject to his or her immediate possession or control, the court must proceed under Penal Code section 1203.097(a)(12). (3) In any review hearing to determine whether a defendant has complied with the requirement to relinquish firearms as specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9, the burden of proof is on the prosecution.

            <div class="rule-title">Requirements for notice  (a) Method of notice  Notice of appearance at a hearing to request emergency orders may be given personally or by telephone, voicemail, fax transmission, electronic means (if permitted), overnight mail, or other overnight carrier.  (Subd (a) amended effective July 1, 2020.  (b) Notice to parties  A party seeking emergency orders under this chapter must give notice to all parties or their attorneys so that it is received no later than 10:00 a.m. on the court day before the matter is to be considered by the court. After providing notice, each party must be served with the documents requesting emergency orders as described in rule 5.167 or as required by local rule. This rule does not apply to a party seeking emergency orders under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act. (1)   Explanation for shorter notice  If a party provided notice of the request for emergency orders to all parties and their attorneys later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the appearance, the party must request in a declaration regarding notice that the court approve the shortened notice. The party must provide facts in the declaration that show exceptional circumstances that justify the shorter notice. (2)   Explanation for waiver of notice (no notice)  A party may ask the court to waive notice to all parties and their attorneys of the request for emergency orders. To make the request, the party must file a written declaration signed under penalty of perjury that includes facts showing good cause not to give the notice. A judicial officer may approve a waiver of notice for good cause, which may include that: (A) Giving notice would frustrate the purpose of the order; (B) Giving notice would result in immediate and irreparable harm to the applicant or the children who may be affected by the order sought; (C) Giving notice would result in immediate and irreparable damage to or loss of property subject to disposition in the case; (D) The parties agreed in advance that notice will not be necessary with respect to the matter that is the subject of the request for emergency orders; and (E) The party made reasonable and good faith efforts to give notice to the other party, and further efforts to give notice would probably be futile or unduly burdensome.  (c) Notice to the court  The court may adopt a local rule requiring that the party provide additional notice to the court that he or she will be requesting emergency orders the next court day. The local rule must include a method by which the party may give notice to the court by telephone.  Rule 5.165 amended effective July 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 2013.

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 5.365</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Procedure for consolidation of child support orders  (a)   When an order of consolidation of actions has been made under section 1048(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure in cases in which a local child support agency is appearing under section 17400 of the Family Code, or when a motion to consolidate or combine two or more child support orders has been made under section 17408 of the Family Code, the cases in which those orders were entered must be consolidated as follows: (1)   Priority of consolidation  The order consolidating cases that contain child support orders must designate the primary court file into which the support orders must be consolidated and must also designate the court files that are subordinate. Absent an order upon showing of good cause, the cases or child support orders must be consolidated into a single court file according to the following priority, including those cases or orders initiated or obtained by a local child support agency under division 17 of the Family Code that are consolidated under either section 1048(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure or section 17408 of the Family Code: (A) If one of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation brought under division 6 of the Family Code, all cases and orders so consolidated must be consolidated into that action, which must be the primary file. (B) If none of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation, but one of the child support orders to be consolidated has been issued in an action under the Uniform Parentage Act (Fam. Code, div. 12, pt. 3), all orders so consolidated must be consolidated into that action, which must be the primary file. (C) If none of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation or in an action under the Uniform Parentage Act, but one of the child support orders to be consolidated has been issued in an action commenced by a Petition for Custody and Support of Minor Children (form FL-260), all orders so consolidated must be consolidated into that action, which must be the primary file. (D) If none of the cases or child support orders to be consolidated is in an action for nullity, dissolution, or legal separation or in an action under the Uniform Parentage Act, the case or cases with the higher number or numbers must be consolidated into the case with the lowest number, which must be the primary file. Child support orders in cases brought under the Domestic Violence Protection Act (Fam. Code, div. 10, pt. 4) or any similar law may be consolidated under this rule. However, a domestic violence case must not be designated as the primary file. (2)   Notice of consolidation  Upon issuance of the consolidation order, the local child support agency must prepare and file in each subordinate case a   Notice of Consolidation   (form FL-920), indicating that the support orders in those actions are consolidated into the primary file. The notice must state the date of the consolidation, the primary file number, and the case number of each of the cases so consolidated. If the local child support agency was not a participant in the proceeding in which the consolidation was ordered, the court must designate the party to prepare and file the notice.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2003.)  (b) Subsequent filings in consolidated cases  Notwithstanding any other rule, including but not limited to rule 367, upon consolidation of cases with child support orders, all filings in those cases, whether dealing with child support or not, must occur in the primary court action and must be filed under that case, caption, and number only. All further orders must be issued only in the primary action, and no further orders may be issued in a subordinate court file. All enforcement and modification of support orders in consolidated cases must occur in the primary court action regardless of in which action the order was originally issued.

(Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Proceedings in different counties  If the petition alleging jurisdiction is filed in one county and the child is already a dependent or ward in another county, a joint assessment must be conducted by the responsible departments of each county. If the departments cannot agree on which will prepare the joint assessment report, then the department in the county where the petition is to be filed must prepare the joint assessment report. (1) The joint assessment report must contain the recommendations and reasoning of both the child welfare and the probation departments.

            <div class="rule-title">Subordinate judicial officers: complaints and notice requirements  (a) Intent  The procedures in this rule for processing complaints against subordinate judicial officers do not: (1) Create a contract of employment; (2) Change the existing employee-employer relationship between the subordinate judicial officer and the court; (3) Change the status of a subordinate judicial officer from an employee terminable at will to an employee terminable only for cause; or (4) Restrict the discretion of the presiding judge in taking appropriate corrective action.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Definitions  Unless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions apply to this rule: (1) "Subordinate judicial officer" means an attorney employed by a court to serve as a commissioner, referee, or hearing officer, whether the attorney is acting as a commissioner, referee, hearing officer, or temporary judge. The term does not include any other attorney acting as a temporary judge. (2) "Presiding judge" includes the person or group the presiding judge designates to perform any duty required by this rule to be performed by a presiding judge. (3) "Commission" means the Commission on Judicial Performance. The commission exercises discretionary jurisdiction over the discipline of subordinate judicial officers under article VI, section 18.1 of the California Constitution. (4) "Written reprimand" means written disciplinary action that is warranted either because of the seriousness of the misconduct or because previous corrective action has been ineffective.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (c) Application  (1) A court that employs a subordinate judicial officer must use the procedures in this rule for processing complaints against the subordinate judicial officer if the complaint alleges conduct that if alleged against a judge would be within the jurisdiction of the commission under article VI, section 18 of the California Constitution. (2) If a complaint against a subordinate judicial officer as described in (f) does not allege conduct that would be within the jurisdiction of the commission, the local procedures adopted under rule 10.603(c)(4)(C) apply. The local process may include any procedures from this rule for the court's adjudication of the complaint other than the provisions for referring the matter to the commission under (g) or giving notice of commission review under (k)(2)(B). (3) A court may adopt additional policies and procedures for the adjudication of complaints against subordinate judicial officers not inconsistent with this rule.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective July 1, 2002 and January 1, 2007.)  (d) Promptness required  The presiding judge must ensure that the court processes each complaint promptly. To the extent reasonably possible, the court must complete action on each complaint within 90 days after the complaint is submitted.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)

            <div class="rule-number">Rule 4.102</div>
            <div class="rule-title">Uniform bail and penalty schedules-traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, business licensing  The Judicial Council of California has established the policy of promulgating uniform bail and penalty schedules for certain offenses in order to achieve a standard of uniformity in the handling of these offenses. In general, bail is used to ensure the presence of the defendant before the court. Under Vehicle Code sections 40512 and 13103, bail may also be forfeited and forfeiture may be ordered without the necessity of any further court proceedings and be treated as a conviction for specified Vehicle Code offenses. A penalty in the form of a monetary sum is a fine imposed as all or a portion of a sentence imposed. To achieve substantial uniformity of bail and penalties throughout the state in traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing cases, the trial court judges, in performing their duty under Penal Code section 1269b to annually revise and adopt a schedule of bail and penalties for all misdemeanor and infraction offenses except Vehicle Code infractions, must give consideration to the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules approved by the Judicial Council. The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule for infraction violations of the Vehicle Code will be established by the Judicial Council in accordance with Vehicle Code section 40310. Judges must give consideration to requiring additional bail for aggravating or enhancing factors. After a court adopts a countywide bail and penalty schedule, under Penal Code section 1269b, the court must, as soon as practicable, mail or e-mail a copy of the schedule to the Judicial Council with a report stating how the revised schedule differs from the council's uniform traffic bail and penalty schedule, uniform boating bail and penalty schedule, uniform fish and game bail and penalty schedule, uniform forestry bail and penalty schedule, uniform public utilities bail and penalty schedule, uniform parks and recreation bail and penalty schedule, or uniform business licensing bail and penalty schedule. The purpose of this uniform bail and penalty schedule is to: (1) Show the standard amount for bail, which for Vehicle Code offenses may also be the amount used for a bail forfeiture instead of further proceedings; and (2) Serve as a guideline for the imposition of a fine as all or a portion of the penalty for a first conviction of a listed offense where a fine is used as all or a portion of the penalty for such offense. The amounts shown for the misdemeanors on the boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing bail and penalty schedules have been set with this dual purpose in mind. Unless otherwise shown, the maximum penalties for the listed offenses are six months in the county jail or a fine of $1,000, or both. The penalty amounts are intended to be used to provide standard fine amounts for a first offense conviction of a violation shown where a fine is used as all or a portion of the sentence imposed.  Note : Courts may obtain copies of the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules by contacting: Criminal Justice Services Judicial Council of California 455 Golden Gate Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102-3688 or Visit Criminal Justice Services to view most recent and past   Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules   under Additional Resources.

            <div class="rule-title">Time frames for transferring jurisdiction  (a) Application  This rule applies to family law actions or family law proceedings for which a transfer of jurisdiction has been ordered under part 2 of title 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  (b) Payment of fees; fee waivers  Responsibility for the payment of court costs and fees for the transfer of jurisdiction as provided in Government Code section 70618 is subject to the following provisions: (1) If a transfer of jurisdiction is ordered in response to a motion made under title 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure by a party, the responsibility for costs and fees is subject to Code of Civil Procedure section 399(a). If the fees are not paid within the time specified in section 399(a), the court may, on a duly noticed motion by any party or on its own motion, dismiss the action without prejudice to the cause of action. Except as provided in (e), no other action on the cause may be commenced in another court before satisfaction of the court's order for fees and costs or a court-ordered waiver of such fees and costs. (2) If a transfer of jurisdiction is ordered by the court on its own motion, the court must specify in its order which party is responsible for the Government Code section 70618 fees. If that party has not paid the fees within five days of service of notice of the transfer order, any other party interested in the action or proceeding may pay the costs and fees and the clerk must transmit the case file. If the fees are not paid within the time period set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 399, the court may, on a duly noticed motion by any party or on its own motion, dismiss the action without prejudice to the cause or enter such other orders as the court deems appropriate. Except as provided in (e), no other action on the cause may be commenced in the original court or another court before satisfaction of the court's order for fees and costs or a court-ordered waiver of such fees and costs. (3) If the party responsible for the fees has been granted a fee waiver by the sending court, the case file must be transmitted as if the fees and costs were paid and the fee waiver order must be transmitted with the case file in lieu of the fees and costs. If a partial fee waiver has been granted, the party responsible for the fees and costs must pay the required portion of the fees and costs before the case will be transmitted. In any case involving a fee waiver, the court receiving the case file has the authority under Government Code section 68636 to review the party's eligibility for a fee waiver based on additional information available to the court or pursuant to a hearing at final disposition of the case. (4) At the hearing to transfer jurisdiction, the court must address any issues regarding fees. If a litigant indicates they cannot afford to pay the fees, a fee waiver request form should be provided by the clerk and the court should promptly rule on that request.  (c) Time frame for transfer of jurisdiction  After a court orders the transfer of jurisdiction over the action or proceeding, the clerk must transmit the case file to the clerk of the court to which the action or proceeding is transferred within five court days of the date of expiration of the 20- day time period to petition for a writ of mandate. If a writ is filed, the clerk must transmit the case file within five court days of the notice that the order is final. The clerk must send notice stating the date of the transmittal to all parties who have appeared in the action or proceeding and the court receiving the transfer.  (d) Time frame to assume jurisdiction over transferred matter  Within 20 court days of the date of the transmittal, the clerk of the court receiving the transferred action or proceeding must send notice to all parties who have appeared in the action or proceeding and the court that ordered the transfer stating the date of the filing of the case and the number assigned to the case in the court.

(2) When a party files a notice electing to use an appendix under this rule, the superior court clerk must promptly send a copy of the register of actions, if any, to the attorney of record for each party and to any unrepresented party.

            <div class="rule-title">Reporter's transcript  (a) Notice  (1) A notice under rule 8.121 designating a reporter's transcript must specify the date of each proceeding to be included in the transcript and may specify portions of designated proceedings that are not to be included. The notice must identify any proceeding for which a certified transcript has previously been prepared by checking the appropriate box on   Appellant's Notice Designating Record on Appeal (Unlimited Civil)   (form APP-003) or, if that form is not used, placing an asterisk before that proceeding in the notice. (2) If the appellant designates less than all the testimony, the notice must state the points to be raised on appeal; the appeal is then limited to those points unless, on motion, the reviewing court permits otherwise. (3) If the appellant serves and files a notice designating a reporter's transcript, the respondent may, within 10 days after such service, serve and file a notice in superior court designating any additional proceedings the respondent wants included in the transcript. The notice must identify any proceeding for which a certified transcript has previously been prepared by checking the appropriate box on   Respondent's Notice Designating Record on Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case)   (form APP-010) or, if that form is not used, placing an asterisk before that proceeding in the notice. (4) If the appellant elects to proceed without a reporter's transcript, the respondent cannot require that a reporter's transcript be prepared. But the reviewing court, on its own or the respondent's motion, may order the record augmented under rule 8.155 to prevent a miscarriage of justice. Unless the court orders otherwise, the appellant is responsible for the cost of any reporter's transcript the court may order under this subdivision. (5) Except when a party submits a certified transcript that contains all the designated proceedings under (b)(3)(C) with the notice of designation, the notice of designation must be served on each known reporter of the designated proceedings.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2014; previously amended effective January 1, 2005, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2008.)  (b) Deposit or substitute for cost of transcript  (1) With its notice of designation, a party must deposit with the superior court clerk the approximate cost of transcribing the proceedings it designates and a fee of $50 for the superior court to hold this deposit in trust. The deposit must be either: (A) The amount specified in the reporter's written estimate; or (B) An amount calculated as follows: (i) For proceedings that have not previously been transcribed: $325 per fraction of the day's proceedings that did not exceed three hours, or $650 per day or fraction that exceeded three hours. (ii) For proceedings that have previously been transcribed: $80 per fraction of the day's proceedings that did not exceed three hours, or $160 per day or fraction that exceeded three hours. (2) If the reporter believes the deposit is inadequate, within 15 days after the clerk sends the notice under (d)(1) the reporter may file with the clerk and send to the designating party an estimate of the transcript's total cost at the statutory rate, showing the additional deposit required. The party must deposit the additional sum within 10 days after the reporter sends the estimate. (3) Instead of a deposit under (1), the party may substitute: (A) The reporter's written waiver of a deposit. A reporter may waive the deposit for a part of the designated proceedings, but such a waiver replaces the deposit for only that part. (B) A copy of a Transcript Reimbursement Fund application filed under (c)(1).  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025</div>

(2) An appellant intending to proceed under this rule for reasons other than those listed in (1) must serve and file in superior court with its notice designating the record on appeal under rule 8.121 a motion to use a settled statement instead of a reporter's transcript. (A) The motion must be supported by a showing that: (i) A substantial cost saving will result and the statement can be settled without significantly burdening opposing parties or the court; (ii) The designated oral proceedings cannot be transcribed; or (iii) Although the appellant does not have a fee waiver, he or she is unable to pay for a reporter's transcript and funds are not available from the Transcript Reimbursement Fund (see rule 8.130(c)).

(b)   If the imposition of a sentence is to be suspended during a period of probation after a conviction by trial, the trial judge must identify and state circumstances that would justify imposition of one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), or any enhancement, if probation is later revoked. The circumstances identified and stated by the judge must be based on evidence admitted at the trial or other circumstances properly considered under rule 4.420(b).

(c)   If a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed, or if the execution of a sentence of imprisonment is to be suspended during a period of probation, the sentencing judge must: (1) Determine, under section 1170(b), whether to impose one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), or any enhancement, and state on the record the reasons for imposing that term; (2) Determine whether any additional term of imprisonment provided for an enhancement charged and found will be stricken; (3) Determine whether the sentences will be consecutive or concurrent if the defendant has been convicted of multiple crimes; (4) Determine any issues raised by statutory prohibitions on the dual use of facts and statutory limitations on enhancements, as required in rules 4.420(c) and 4.447; and (5) Pronounce the court's judgment and sentence, stating the terms thereof and giving reasons for those matters for which reasons are required by law.

    "title": "Format of electronic documents  (a) Formatting requirements applicable to all electronic documents  (1)   Text-searchable portable document format : Electronic documents must be in text-searchable portable document format (PDF) while maintaining the original document formatting. In the limited circumstances in which a document cannot practicably be converted to a text-searchable PDF, the document may be scanned or converted to non-text- searchable PDF. An electronic filer is not required to use a specific vendor, technology, or software for creation of a searchable-format document, unless the electronic filer agrees to such use. The software for creating and reading electronic documents must be in the public domain or generally available at a reasonable cost. The printing of an electronic document must not result in the loss of document text, formatting, or appearance. The electronic filer is responsible for ensuring that any document filed is complete and readable. (2)   Pagination : The electronic page counter for the electronic document must match the page number for each page of the document. The page numbering of a document filed electronically must begin with the first page or cover page as page 1 and thereafter be paginated consecutively using only arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3). The page number for the cover page may be suppressed and need not appear on the cover page. When a document is filed in both paper form and electronic form, the pagination in both versions must comply with this paragraph. (3)   Bookmarking : An electronic bookmark is a descriptive text link that appears in the bookmarks panel of an electronic document. Each electronic document must include an electronic bookmark to each heading, subheading, and the first page of any component of the document, including any table of contents, table of authorities, petition, verification, memorandum, declaration, certificate of word count, certificate of interested entities or persons, proof of service, exhibit, or attachment. Each electronic bookmark must briefly describe the item to which it is linked. For example, an electronic bookmark to a heading must provide the text of the heading, and an electronic bookmark to an exhibit or attachment must include the letter or number of the exhibit or attachment and a brief description of the exhibit or attachment. An electronic appendix must have bookmarks to the indexes and to the first page of each separate exhibit or attachment. Exhibits or attachments within an exhibit or attachment must be bookmarked. All bookmarks must be set to retain the reader's selected zoom setting. (4)   Protection of sensitive information : Electronic filers must comply with rules 1.201, 8.45, 8.46, 8.47, and 8.401 regarding the protection of sensitive information, except for those requirements exclusively applicable to paper form. (5)   Size and multiple files : An electronic filing may not be larger than 25 megabytes. This rule does not change the limitations on word count or number of pages otherwise established by the California Rules of Court for documents filed in the court. Although certain provisions in the California Rules of Court require volumes of no more than 300 pages (see, e.g., rules 8.124(d)(1), 8.144(b)(6), 8.144(g)), an electronic filing may exceed 300 pages so long as its individual components comply with the 300-page volume requirement and the electronic filing does not exceed 25 megabytes. If a document exceeds the 25-megabyte file-size limitation, the electronic filer must submit the document in more than one file, with each file 25 megabytes or less. The first file must include a master chronological and alphabetical index stating the contents for all files. Each file must have a cover page stating (a) the file number for that file and the total number of files for that document, (b) the volumes contained in that file, and (c) the page numbers contained in that file. (For example: File 2 of 4, Volumes 3-4, pp. 301-499.) In addition, each file must be paginated consecutively across all files in the document, including the cover pages for each file. (For example, if the first file ends on page 300, the cover of the second file must be page 301.) If a multiple-file document is submitted to the court in both electronic form and paper form, the cover pages for each file must be included in the paper documents. (6)   Manual Filing : (A) When an electronic filer seeks to file an electronic document consisting of more than 10 files, or when the document cannot or should not be electronically filed in multiple files, or when electronically filing the document  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",

An electronic appendix must have bookmarks to the indexes and to the first page of each separate exhibit or attachment. Exhibits or attachments within an exhibit or attachment must be bookmarked. All bookmarks must be set to retain the reader's selected zoom setting. (4) Protection of sensitive information : Electronic filers must comply with rules 1.201, 8.45, 8.46, 8.47, and 8.401 regarding the protection of sensitive information, except for those requirements exclusively applicable to paper form. (5) Size and multiple files : An electronic filing may not be larger than 25 megabytes. This rule does not change the limitations on word count or number of pages otherwise established by the California Rules of Court for documents filed in the court. Although certain provisions in the California Rules of Court require volumes of no more than 300 pages (see, e.g., rules 8.124(d)(1), 8.144(b)(6), 8.144(g)), an electronic filing may exceed 300 pages so long as its individual components comply with the 300-page volume requirement and the electronic filing does not exceed 25 megabytes. If a document exceeds the 25-megabyte file-size limitation, the electronic filer must submit the document in more than one file, with each file 25 megabytes or less. The first file must include a master chronological and alphabetical index stating the contents for all files. Each file must have a cover page stating (a) the file number for that file and the total number of files for that document, (b) the volumes contained in that file, and (c) the page numbers contained in that file. (For example: File 2 of 4, Volumes 3-4, pp. 301-499.) In addition, each file must be paginated consecutively across all files in the document, including the cover pages for each file. (For example, if the first file ends on page 300, the cover of the second file must be page 301.) If a multiple-file document is submitted to the court in both electronic form and paper form, the cover pages for each file must be included in the paper documents. (6) Manual Filing : (A) When an electronic filer seeks to file an electronic document consisting of more than 10 files, or when the document cannot or should not be electronically filed in multiple files, or when electronically filing the document CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 would cause undue hardship, the document must not be electronically filed but must be manually filed with the court on an electronic medium such as a flash drive, DVD, or compact disc (CD). When an electronic filer files with the court one or more documents on an electronic medium, the electronic filer must electronically file, on the same day, a \"manual filing notification\" notifying the court and the parties that one or more documents have been filed on electronic media, explaining the reason for the manual filing. The electronic media must be served on the parties in accordance with the requirements for service of paper documents. To the extent practicable, each document or file on electronic media must comply with the format requirements of this rule. (B) Electronic media files such as audio or video must be manually filed. Audio files must be filed in .wav or mp3 format. Video files must be filed in .avi or mp4 format. (C) If manually filed, photographs must be filed in .jpg, .png, .tif, or .pdf format. (D) If an original electronic media file is converted to a required format for manual filing, the electronic filer must retain the original. (7) Page size : All documents must have a page size of 8-1/2 by 11 inches. (8) Color : An electronic document with a color component may be electronically filed or manually filed on electronic media, depending on its file size. An electronic document must not have a color cover. (9) Cover or first-page information : Except as provided in (B), the cover-or first page, if there is no cover-of every electronic document filed in a reviewing court must include the name, mailing address, telephone number, fax number (if available), email address (if available), and California State Bar number of each attorney filing or joining in the document, or of the party if he or she is unrepresented. The inclusion of a fax number or email address on any electronic document does not constitute consent to service by fax or email unless otherwise provided by law. If more than one attorney from a law firm, corporation, or public law office is representing one party and is joining in the document, the name and State Bar number of each attorney joining in the electronic document must be provided on the cover. The law firm, corporation, or public law office representing each party must designate one attorney to receive notices and other communication in the case from the court by placing an asterisk before that attorney's name on the cover and must provide the contact information specified under (A) for that attorney. Contact information for the other attorneys from the same law firm, corporation, or public law office is not required but may be provided. (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2011.) (b) Additional formatting requirements applicable to documents prepared for electronic filing in the first instance in a reviewing court (1) Font : The font style must be a proportionally spaced serif face. Century Schoolbook is preferred. A sans-serif face may be used for headings, subheadings, and captions. Font size must be 13-points, including in footnotes. Case names must be italicized or underscored. For emphasis, italics or boldface may be used or the text may be underscored. Do not use all capitals (i.e., ALL CAPS) for emphasis. (2) Spacing : Lines of text must be 1.5 spaced. Footnotes, headings, subheadings, and quotations may be single-spaced. The lines of text must be unnumbered. (3) Margins : The margins must be set at 1-1/2 inches on the left and right and 1 inch on the top and bottom. Quotations may be block-indented. (4) Alignment : Paragraphs must be left-aligned, not justified. (5) Hyperlinks : Hyperlinks to legal authorities and appendixes or exhibits are encouraged but not required. However, if an electronic filer elects to include hyperlinks in a document, the hyperlink must be active as of the date of filing, and if the hyperlink is to a legal authority, it should be formatted to standard citation format as provided in the California Rules of Court. (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2017.) (c) Additional formatting requirements for certain electronic documents (1) Brief : In addition to compliance with this rule, an electronic brief must also comply with the contents and length requirements stated in rule 8.204(a) and (c). The brief need not be signed. The cover must state: (A) The title of the brief; (B) The title, trial court number, and Court of Appeal number of the case; (C) The names of the trial court and each participating trial judge; and (D) The name of the party that each attorney on the brief represents. (2) Request for judicial notice or request, application, or motion supported by documents : When seeking judicial notice of matter not already in the appellate record, or when a request, application, or motion is supported by matter not already in the appellate record, the electronic filer must attach a copy of the matter to the request, application, or motion, or an explanation of why it is not practicable to do so. The request, application, or motion and its attachments must comply with this rule. (3) Appendix : The format of an appendix must comply with this rule and rule 8.144 pertaining to clerks' transcripts. (4) Agreed statement and settled statement : The format for an agreed statement or a settled statement must comply with this rule and rule 8.144. (5) Reporter's transcript and clerk's transcript : The format for an electronic reporter's transcript must comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 271 and rule 8.144. The format for an electronic clerk's transcript must comply with this rule and rule 8.144. (6) Exhibits : Electronic exhibits must be submitted in files no larger than 25 megabytes, rather than as individual documents. (7) Sealed and confidential records : Under rule 8.45(c)(1), electronic records that are sealed or confidential must be filed separately from publicly filed records. If one or more pages are omitted from a record and filed separately as a sealed or confidential record, an omission page or pages must be inserted in the publicly filed record at the location of the omitted page or pages. The omission page or pages must identify the type of page or pages omitted. Each omission page must be paginated consecutively with the rest of the publicly filed record. Each single omission page or the first omission page in a range of omission pages must be bookmarked and must be listed in any indexes included in the publicly filed record. The PDF counter for each omission page must match the page number of the page omitted from the publicly filed record. Separately-filed sealed or confidential records must comply with this rule and rules 8.45, 8.46, and 8.47. (Subd (c) adopted effective January 1, 2020.) (d) Other formatting rules This rule prevails over other formatting rules. (Subd (d) adopted effective January 1, 2020.) Rule 8.74 amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted as rule 8.76 effective July 1, 2010; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2011. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a)(1 ). If an electronic filer must file a document that the electronic filer possesses only in paper form, use of a scanned image is a permitted means of conversion to PDF, but optical character recognition must be used, if possible. If a document cannot practicably be converted to a text-searchable PDF (e.g., if the document is entirely or substantially handwritten, a photograph, or a graphic such as a chart or diagram that is not primarily text based), the document may be converted to a non-text-searchable PDF file. Subdivision (a)(3 ). An electronic bookmark's brief description of the item to which it is linked should enable the reader to easily identify the item. For example, if a declaration is attached to a document, the bookmark to the declaration might say \"Robert Smith Declaration,\" and if a complaint is attached to a declaration as an exhibit, the bookmark to the complaint might say \"Exhibit A, First Amended Complaint filed 8/12/17.\" Subdivision (b ). Subdivision (b) governs documents prepared for electronic filing in the first instance in a reviewing court and does not apply to previously created documents (such as exhibits), whose formatting cannot or should not be altered. Subdivision (c)(7 ). In identifying the type of pages omitted, the omission page might say, for example, \"probation report\" or \" Marsden hearing transcript.\"",

Stipulations must be signed by and served on all parties. (2) A stipulation under (1) is effective on filing. The reviewing court may not shorten a stipulated extension. (3) Before the brief is due, a party may apply to the presiding justice for an extension of each period under (a), or under rule 8.200(c)(6) or (7), on a showing that there is good cause and that: (A) The applicant was unable to obtain-or it would have been futile to seek-the extension by stipulation; or (B) The parties have stipulated to the maximum extension permitted under (1) and the applicant seeks a further extension. (4) A party need not apply for an extension or relief from default if it can file its brief within the time prescribed by rule 8.220(a). The clerk must file a brief submitted within that time if it otherwise complies with these rules. (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2015; previously amended effective January 1, 2003, July 1, 2005, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2010, January 1, 2011, January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2014.)

Rule 8.212 amended effective January 1, 2018; repealed and adopted as rule 15 effective January 1, 2002; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2003, January 1, 2004, January 1, 2005, July 1, 2005, January 1, 2008, January 1, 2010, January 1, 2011, January 1, 2013, January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2015. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). Note that the sequence and timing of briefing in appeals in which a party is both appellant and respondent (cross- appeals) are governed by rule 8.216. Typically, a cross-appellant's combined respondent's brief and opening brief must be filed within the time specified in (a)(2) for the respondent's brief. Subdivision (b). Extensions of briefing time are limited by statute in some cases. For example, under Public Resources Code section 21167.6(h) in cases under section 21167, extensions are limited to one 30-day extension for the opening brief and one 30- day extension for \"preparation of responding brief.\" Under rule 8.42, the original signature of only one party is required on the stipulation filed with the court; the signatures of the other parties may be in the form of copies of the signed signature page of the document. Signatures on electronically filed documents are subject to the requirements of rule 8.77. Subdivision (b)(2) clarifies that a party seeking an extension of time from the presiding justice must proceed by application under rule 8.50 rather than by motion under rule 8.54. Subdivision (c). In subdivision (c)(2) the word \"brief\" means only (1) an appellant's opening brief, (2) a respondent's brief, (3) an appellant's reply brief, (4) an amicus curiae brief, or (5) an answer thereto. It follows that no other documents or papers filed in the Court of Appeal, whatever their nature, should be served on the Supreme Court. Further, only briefs filed in the Court of Appeal \"in a civil appeal\" must be served on the Supreme Court. It follows that no briefs filed in the Court of Appeal in criminal appeals or in original proceedings should be served on the Supreme Court. Information about electronic submission of copies of briefs to the Court of Appeal can be found on the web page for the Court of Appeal district in which the brief is being filed on the California Courts website at www.courts.ca.gov/courtsofappeal . Examples of \"undue hardship\" under (2)(C) include but are not limited to when a party does not have access to a computer or the software necessary to prepare an electronic copy of a brief or does not have e-mail access to electronically submit a brief to the Court of Appeal.",

(c) Length (1) Except as provided in (5), a brief produced on a computer must not exceed 14,000 words, including footnotes.

(3) The tables required under (a)(1), the cover information required under (b)(10), the Certificate of Interested Entities or Persons required under rule 8.208, a certificate under (1), any signature block, and any attachment under (d) are excluded from the limits stated in (1) or (2). (4) A combined brief in an appeal governed by rule 8.216 must not exceed double the limits stated in (1) or (2). (5) A petition for rehearing or an answer to a petition for rehearing produced on a computer must not exceed 7,000 words, including footnotes.

(d) Attachments to briefs A party filing a brief may attach copies of exhibits or other materials in the appellate record or copies of relevant local, state, or federal regulations or rules, out-of-state statutes, or other similar citable materials that are not readily accessible. These attachments must not exceed a combined total of 10 pages, but on application the presiding justice may permit additional pages of attachments for good cause.

(e) Noncomplying briefs If a brief does not comply with this rule: (1) The reviewing court clerk may decline to file it, but must mark it \"received but not filed\" and return it to the party; or (2) If the brief is filed, the reviewing court may, on its own or a party's motion, with or without notice: (A) Order the brief returned for corrections and refiling within a specified time; (B) Strike the brief with leave to file a new brief within a specified time; or (C) Disregard the noncompliance. (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2006.) Rule 8.204 amended effective January 1, 2024; repealed and adopted as rule 14 effective January 1, 2002; previously amended and renumbered as rule 8.204 effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2004, July 1, 2004, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2011, January 1, 2013, January 1, 2014, January 1, 2016, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b). The first sentence of subdivision (b)(1) confirms that any method of reproduction is acceptable provided it results in a clear black image of letter quality. The provision is derived from subdivision (a)(1) of rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (28 U.S.C.) (FRAP 32). Paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subdivision (b) state requirements of font, font style, and font size (see also subd. (b)(11)(C)). Subdivision (b)(2) allows the use of any conventional font-e.g., Times New Roman, Courier, Arial, Helvetica, etc.-and permits the font to be either proportionally spaced or monospaced. Subdivision (b)(3) requires the font style to be roman, but permits the use of italics, boldface, or underscoring for emphasis; it also requires case names to be italicized or underscored. These provisions are derived from FRAP 32(a)(6). Subdivision (b)(5) allows headings to be single-spaced; it is derived from FRAP 32(a)(4). The provision also permits quotations of any length to be block-indented and single-spaced at the discretion of the brief writer. See also rule 1.200 concerning the format of citations. Brief writers are encouraged to follow the citation form of the California Style Manual (4th ed., 2000). Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) governs the maximum permissible length of a brief. It is derived from the federal procedure of measuring the length of a brief produced on a computer by the number of words in the brief. (FRAP 32(a)(7).) Subdivision (c)(1), like FRAP 32(a)(7)(B)(i), imposes a limit of 14,000 words if the brief is produced on a computer. Subdivision (c)(1) implements this provision by requiring the writer of a brief produced on a computer to include a certificate stating the number of words in the brief, but allows the writer to rely on the word count of the computer program used to prepare the brief. This requirement, too, is adapted from the federal rule. (FRAP 32(a)(7)(C).) For purposes of this rule, a \"brief produced on a computer\" includes a commercially printed brief. Subdivision (c)(3) specifies certain items that are not counted toward the maximum brief length. Signature blocks, as referenced in this provision, include not only the signatures, but also the printed names, titles, and affiliations of any attorneys filing or joining in the brief, which may accompany the signature. Subdivision (c)(5) clarifies that a party seeking permission to exceed the page or word limits stated in subdivision (c)(1) and (2) must proceed by application under rule 8.50, rather than by motion under rule 8.54, and must show good cause. Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) permits a party filing a brief to attach copies of exhibits or other materials, provided they are part of the record on appeal and do not exceed a total of 10 pages. If the brief writer attaches, under rule 8.1115(c), a copy of an unpublished opinion or an opinion available only in computerized form, that opinion does not count toward the 10-page limit stated in rule 8.204(d). Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) states the consequences of submitting briefs that do not comply with this rule: (e)(1) recognizes the power of the reviewing court clerk to decline to file such a brief, and (e)(2) recognizes steps the reviewing court may take to obtain a brief that does comply with the rule. Subdivision (e)(2) does not purport to limit the inherent power of the reviewing court to fashion other sanctions for such noncompliance.",

(i) An application or an opposition or other response to an application; (ii) A motion or an opposition or other response to a motion; CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (iii) A respondent's brief; (iv) A preliminary opposition to a petition for a writ, excluding a preliminary opposition requested by the court unless the court has notified the parties that it is considering issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance; (v) A return (by demurrer, verified answer, or both) after the court issues an alternative writ or order to show cause; (vi) Any answer to a petition for review in the Supreme Court; and (vii) Any brief filed in the Supreme Court after the court grants review. (3) If a document other than the notice of appeal or a petition for a writ is not accompanied by the filing fee or an application for a waiver of court fees under rule 8.26, the clerk must file the document and must promptly notify the filing party in writing that the court may strike the document unless, within the stated time of not less than 5 court days after the notice is sent, the filing party either: (A) Pays the filing fee; or (B) Files an application for a waiver under rule 8.26 if the party has not previously filed such an application. (4) If the party fails to take the action specified in a notice given under (3), the reviewing court may strike the document, but may vacate the striking of the document for good cause. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted effective October 28, 2011.) Rule 8.25 amended effective January 1, 2021; adopted as rule 40.1 effective January 1, 2005; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2009, July 1, 2010, January 1, 2011, October 28, 2011, July 1, 2012, January 1, 2018. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a ). Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6- 1013a describe generally permissible methods of service. Information Sheet for Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP-009-INFO) provides additional information about how to serve documents and how to provide proof of service. In the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeal, registration with the court's electronic filing service provider is deemed to show agreement to accept service electronically at the email address provided, unless a party affirmatively opts out of electronic service under rule 8.78(a)(2)(B). This procedure differs from the procedure for electronic service in the superior courts, including their appellate divisions. See rules 2.250-2.261. Subdivision (b). In general, to be filed on time, a document must be received by the clerk before the time for filing that document expires. There are, however, some limited exceptions to this general rule. For example, (5) provides that if the clerk receives a document by mail from a custodial institution after the deadline for filing the document has expired but the envelope shows that the document was mailed or delivered to custodial officials for mailing before the deadline expired, the document is deemed timely. This provision applies to notices of appeal as well as to other documents mailed from a custodial institution and reflects the \"prison-delivery\" exception articulated by the California Supreme Court in In re Jordan (1992) 4 Cal.4th 116 and Silverbrand v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 46 Cal.4th 106. Note that if a deadline runs from the date of filing, it runs from the date that the document is actually received and deemed filed under (b)(1); neither (b)(3) nor (b)(5) changes that date. Nor do these provisions extend the date of finality of an appellate opinion or any other deadline that is based on finality, such as the deadline for the court to modify its opinion or order rehearing. Subdivision (b)(5) is also not intended to limit a criminal defendant's appeal rights under the case law of constructive filing. (See, e.g., In re Benoit (1973) 10 Cal.3d 72.) Subdivision (b)(3). This rule includes applications to file amicus curiae briefs because, under rules 8.200(c)(4) and 8.520(f)(5), a proposed amicus curiae brief must accompany the application to file the brief. Subdivision (c). Government Code section 68926 establishes fees in civil cases for filing a notice of appeal, filing a petition a for a writ within the original civil jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal, and for a party other than appellant or petitioner filing its first document in such an appeal or writ proceeding in the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal. Government Code section 68927 establishes fees for filing a petition for review in a civil case in the Supreme Court and for a party other than the petitioner filing its first document in a civil case in the Supreme Court. These statutes provide that fees may not be charged in appeals from, petitions for writs involving, or petitions for review from decisions in juvenile cases or proceedings to declare a minor free from parental custody or control, or proceedings under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code). Subdivision (c)(2)(A) and (D). Under rule 8.100(f), \"notice of appeal\" includes a notice of a cross-appeal and a respondent who files a notice of cross-appeal in a civil appeal is considered an appellant and is required to pay the fee for filing a notice of appeal under Government Code section 68926. A person who files an application to file an amicus brief is not a \"party\" and therefore is not subject to the fees applicable to a party other than the appellant or petitioner. Subdivision (c)(3). Rule 8.100 establishes the procedures applicable when an appellant in a civil appeal fails to pay the fee for filing a notice of appeal or the deposit for the clerk's transcript that must also be paid at that time. 1",

CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (c) Electronic filing by court order (1) If a court has adopted local rules for permissive electronic filing, then the court may, on the motion of any party or on its own motion, provided that the order would not cause undue hardship or significant prejudice to any party, order all parties in any class action, a consolidated action, a group of actions, a coordinated action, or an action that is complex under rule 3.403 to file all documents electronically. (2) A court may combine an order for mandatory electronic filing with an order for mandatory electronic service as provided in rule 2.252(d). (3) If the court proposes to make any order under (1) on its own motion, the court must mail notice to any parties that have not consented to receive electronic service. The court may electronically serve the notice on any party that has consented to receive electronic service. Any party may serve and file an opposition within 10 days after notice is mailed or electronically served or such later time as the court may specify. (4) If the court has previously ordered parties in a case to electronically file documents and a new party is added that the court determines should also be ordered to do so under (1), the court may follow the notice procedures under (2) or may order the party to electronically file documents and in its order state that the new party may object within 10 days after service of the order or by such later time as the court may specify. (5) The court's order may also provide that: (A) Documents previously filed in paper form may be resubmitted in electronic form; and (B) When the court sends confirmation of filing to all parties, receipt of the confirmation constitutes service of the filing if the filed document is available electronically. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as subd (a) and part of subd (b); previously amended and relettered as subd (c) effective July 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2011.)

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b)(1). This subdivision allows courts to institute mandatory electronic filing and service in any type of civil case for which the court determines that mandatory electronic filing is appropriate. The scope of this authorization is meant to be broad. It will enable courts to implement mandatory electronic filing in a flexible yet expansive manner. However, in initiating mandatory electronic filing, courts should take into account the fact that some civil case types may be easier and more cost-effective to implement at the outset while other types may require special procedures or other considerations (such as the need to preserve the confidentiality of filed records) that may make them less appropriate for inclusion in initial mandatory e-filing efforts. Subdivision (b)(2). Although this rule exempts self-represented parties from any mandatory electronic filing and service requirements, these parties are encouraged to participate voluntarily in electronic filing and service. To the extent feasible, courts and other entities should assist self-represented parties to electronically file and serve documents. Subdivision (c). Court-ordered electronic filing under this subdivision is not subject to the provisions in (b) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 requiring that, where mandatory electronic filing and service are established by local rule, the court and the parties must have access to more than one electronic filing service provider.",

A party other than the appellant or petitioner who files a motion or opposition to a motion may be required to pay a filing fee under Government Code sections 68926 or 68927 if the motion or opposition is the first document filed in the appeal or writ proceeding in the reviewing court by that party. See rule 8.25(c). Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) provides that a \"failure to oppose a motion\" may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. The provision is not intended to indicate a position on the question whether there is an implied right to a hearing to oppose a motion to dismiss an appeal. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025",

See, for example, rule 8.150, which specifies the number of copies of the record that must be filed. Information about electronic submission of copies of documents can be found on the web page for the Supreme Court at: www.courts.ca.gov/appellatebriefs or for the Court of Appeal District in which the brief is being filed at: www.courts.ca.gov/courtsofappeal. Note that submitting an electronic copy of a document under this rule or under a local rule adopted pursuant to subdivision (c) does not constitute filing a document electronically under rules 8.70-8.79 and thus does not substitute for the filing of the original document with the court in paper format.",

(2) Supplemental briefs must be limited to matters arising after the previous Court of Appeal decision in the cause, unless the presiding justice permits briefing on other matters. (3) Supplemental briefs may not be filed if the previous decision of the Court of Appeal was a denial of a petition for a writ within its original jurisdiction without issuance of an alternative writ or order to show cause. (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2003.) (c) Amicus curiae briefs (1) Within 14 days after the last appellant's reply brief is filed or could have been filed under rule 8.212, whichever is earlier, any person or entity may serve and file an application for permission of the presiding justice to file an amicus curiae brief. If no respondent’s brief is filed, the application is due within 34 days after the respondent’s brief could have been filed. For good cause, the presiding justice may allow later filing. (2) The application must state the applicant's interest and explain how the proposed amicus curiae brief will assist the court in deciding the matter. (3) The application must also identify: (A) Any party or any counsel for a party in the pending appeal who: (i) Authored the proposed amicus brief in whole or in part; or (ii) Made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of the brief; and (B) Every person or entity who made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of the brief, other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel in the pending appeal. (4) The proposed brief must be served and must accompany the application, and may be combined with it. (5) The covers of the application and proposed brief must identify the party the applicant supports, if any. (6) If the court grants the application, any party may file an answer within the time the court specifies. The answer must be served on all parties and the amicus curiae. (7) The Attorney General may file an amicus curiae brief without the presiding justice's permission, unless the brief is submitted on behalf of another state officer or agency. The Attorney General must serve and file the brief within 14 days after the last appellant's reply brief is filed or could have been filed under rule 8.212, whichever is earlier. If no CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 respondent’s brief is filed, the Attorney General must serve and file the amicus curiae brief within 34 days after the respondent’s brief could have been filed. The brief must provide the information required by (2) and comply with (5). Any party may serve and file an answer within 14 days after the brief is filed. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2025; adopted as subd (b); previously relettered effective January 1, 2003; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2009.) Rule 8.200 amended effective January 1, 2025; repealed and adopted as rule 13 effective January 1, 2002; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2003, January 1, 2008, January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2017. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a)(2). A respondent, other than a respondent who has filed a notice of cross-appeal, who files a respondent's brief may be required to pay a filing fee under Government Code sections 68926 if the respondent's brief is the first document filed in the appellate proceeding in the Court of Appeal by that party. See rule 8.25(c). Subdivision (b). After the Supreme Court remands or transfers a cause to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings (i.e., under rules 8.528(c)-(e) or 10.1000(a)(1)(B)), the parties are permitted to file supplemental briefs. The first 15-day briefing period begins on the day of finality (under rule 8.532) of the Supreme Court decision remanding or order transferring the cause to the Court of Appeal. The rule specifies that \"any party\" may file a supplemental opening brief, and if such a brief is filed, \"any opposing party\" may file a supplemental responding brief. In this context the phrase \"any party\" is intended to mean any or all parties. Such a decision or order of transfer to the Court of Appeal thus triggers, first, a 15-day period in which any or all parties may file supplemental opening briefs and, second-if any party files such a brief-an additional 15-day period in which any opposing party may file a supplemental responding brief. Subdivision (c)(1). The time within which a reply brief \"could have been filed under rule 8.212\" includes any authorized extension of the deadline specified in rule 8.212. The time within which a respondent’s brief “could have been filed” includes any authorized extension of the deadline specified in rule 8.212 and the 15-day default notice period specified in rule 8.220(a).",

In submitting electronic filings, the electronic filing service provider does so on behalf of the electronic filer and not as an agent of the court. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (10) An \"electronic signature\" is an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign a document or record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means. (11) A \"secure electronic signature\" is a type of electronic signature that is unique to the person using it, capable of verification, under the sole control of the person using it, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is invalidated. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2022; adopted as subd (d) effective January 1, 2011; previously amended effective January 1, 2012; previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017) Rule 8.70 amended effective January 1, 2022; adopted effective July 1, 2010; previously amended effective January 1, 2011, January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2017. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (c)(3 ). The definition of \"electronic service\" has been amended to provide that a party may effectuate service not only by the electronic transmission of a document, but also by providing electronic notification of where a document served electronically may be located and downloaded. This amendment is intended to expressly authorize electronic notification as an alternative means of service. This amendment is consistent with the amendment of Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, effective January 1, 2011, to authorize service by electronic notification. (See Stats. 2010, ch. 156 (Sen. Bill 1274).) The amendments change the law on electronic service as understood by the appellate court in Insyst, Ltd. v. Applied Materials, Inc . (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1129, which interpreted the rules as authorizing only electronic transmission as an effective means of electronic service. Subdivision (c)(10 ). The definition of electronic signature is based on the definition in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code section 1633.2. Subdivision (c)(11 ). The definition of secure electronic signature is based on the first four requirements of a \"digital signature\" set forth in Government Code section 16.5(a), specifically the requirements stated in section 16.5(a)(1)-(4). The section 16.5(a)(5) requirement of conformance to regulations adopted by the Secretary of State does not apply to secure electronic signatures.",

Actions by court on receipt of electronically submitted document; date and time of filing (a) Confirmation of receipt and filing of document (1) Confirmation of receipt When the court receives an electronically submitted document, the court must arrange to promptly send the electronic filer confirmation of the court's receipt of the document, indicating the date and time of receipt by the court. (2) Filing If the electronically submitted document received by the court complies with filing requirements, the document is deemed filed on the date and time it was received by the court as stated in the confirmation of receipt. (3) Confirmation of filing When the court files an electronically submitted document, the court must arrange to promptly send the electronic filer confirmation that the document has been filed. The filing confirmation must indicate the date and time of filing as specified in the confirmation of receipt, and must also specify: (A) Any transaction number associated with the filing; and (B) The titles of the documents as filed by the court. (4) Transmission of confirmations The court must arrange to send receipt and filing confirmation to the electronic filer at the electronic service address that the filer furnished to the court under rule 8.72(b)(2). The court or the electronic filing service provider must maintain a record of all receipt and filing confirmations. (5) Filer responsible for verification In the absence of confirmation of receipt and filing, there is no presumption that the court received and filed the document. The electronic filer is responsible for verifying that the court received and filed any document that the electronic filer submitted to the court electronically. (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2021; previously amended effective January 1, 2011, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020.) (b) Notice of rejection of document for filing If the clerk does not file a document because it does not comply with applicable filing requirements, the court must arrange to promptly send notice of the rejection of the document for filing to the electronic filer. The notice must state the reasons that the document was rejected for filing. (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017.) (c) Document received after close of business A document that is received electronically by the court after 11:59 p.m. is deemed to have been received on the next court day. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2011.) (d) Delayed delivery If a filer fails to meet a filing deadline imposed by court order, rule, or statute because of a failure at any point in the electronic transmission and receipt of a document, the filer may file the document on paper or electronically as soon thereafter as practicable and accompany the filing with a motion to accept the document as timely filed. For good cause CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 shown, the court may enter an order permitting the document to be filed nunc pro tunc to the date the filer originally sought to transmit the document electronically. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2017.) (e) Endorsement (1) The court's endorsement of a document electronically filed must contain the following: \"Electronically filed by [Name of Court], on _____ (date),\" followed by the name of the court clerk. (2) The endorsement required under (1) has the same force and effect as a manually affixed endorsement stamp with the signature and initials of the court clerk. (3) A record on appeal, brief, or petition in an appeal or original proceeding that is filed and endorsed electronically may be printed and served on the appellant or respondent in the same manner as if it had been filed in paper form. (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2012.) Rule 8.77 amended effective January 1, 2021; adopted as rule 8.79 effective July 1, 2010; previously amended effective January 1, 2011, January 1, 2012, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020.",

(2) After receiving the proposal, the reviewing court must order a briefing sequence and prescribe briefing periods consistent with rule 8.212(a). (3) Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Contents of briefs  (1) A party that is both an appellant and a respondent must combine its respondent's brief with its appellant's opening brief or its reply brief, if any, whichever is appropriate under the briefing sequence that the reviewing court orders. (2) A combined brief must address the points raised in each appeal separately but may include a single summary of the significant facts. (3) A party must confine a reply brief, or the reply portion of a combined brief, to points raised in its appeal.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2009; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 8.216 applies, first, to all cases in which opposing parties both appeal from the judgment. In addition, it applies to all cases in which one party appeals from the judgment and another party appeals from any appealable order arising from or related to the judgment, i.e., not only orders contemplated by rule 8.108 (denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict) but also, for example, posttrial orders granting or denying attorney fees. The purpose of the rule is to provide, in all such appeals, a single unified procedure for resolving uncertainties as to the order in which the parties must file their briefs. As used in this rule, \"appellant\" includes cross-appellant and \"respondent\" includes cross-respondent. (Compare rule 8.100(e).)  Subdivision (a).   Subdivision (a) implements the above-stated purpose by providing a procedure for determining both the briefing  sequence -i.e., the order in which the parties must file their briefs-and the briefing   periods -i.e., the periods of time (e.g., 30 days or 70 days, etc.) within which the briefs must be filed. Subdivision (a)(1) places the burden on the parties in the first instance to propose a briefing sequence, jointly if possible but separately if not. The purpose of this requirement is to assist the reviewing court by giving it the benefit of the parties' views on what is the most efficient briefing sequence in the circumstances of the case. Subdivision (a)(2) then prescribes the role of the reviewing court: after considering the parties' proposal, the court will decide on the briefing sequence, prescribe the briefing periods, and notify the parties of both. The reviewing court, of course, may thereafter modify its order just as it may do in a single-appeal case. Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b).  Subdivision (b).   The purpose of subdivision (b)(3) is to ensure that in its reply brief a party addresses only issues germane to its own appeal. For example, a cross-appellant may not use its   cross-appellant's   reply brief to answer points raised in the   appellant's  reply brief.  CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",

In addition, it applies to all cases in which one party appeals from the judgment and another party appeals from any appealable order arising from or related to the judgment, i.e., not only orders contemplated by rule 8.108 (denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict) but also, for example, posttrial orders granting or denying attorney fees. The purpose of the rule is to provide, in all such appeals, a single unified procedure for resolving uncertainties as to the order in which the parties must file their briefs. As used in this rule, \"appellant\" includes cross-appellant and \"respondent\" includes cross-respondent. (Compare rule 8.100(e).) Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) implements the above-stated purpose by providing a procedure for determining both the briefing sequence -i.e., the order in which the parties must file their briefs-and the briefing periods -i.e., the periods of time (e.g., 30 days or 70 days, etc.) within which the briefs must be filed. Subdivision (a)(1) places the burden on the parties in the first instance to propose a briefing sequence, jointly if possible but separately if not. The purpose of this requirement is to assist the reviewing court by giving it the benefit of the parties' views on what is the most efficient briefing sequence in the circumstances of the case. Subdivision (a)(2) then prescribes the role of the reviewing court: after considering the parties' proposal, the court will decide on the briefing sequence, prescribe the briefing periods, and notify the parties of both. The reviewing court, of course, may thereafter modify its order just as it may do in a single-appeal case. Extensions of time are governed by rule 8.212(b). Subdivision (b). The purpose of subdivision (b)(3) is to ensure that in its reply brief a party addresses only issues germane to its own appeal. For example, a cross-appellant may not use its cross-appellant's reply brief to answer points raised in the appellant's reply brief. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025",

(d) Additional provisions for electronic service required by court order (1) If a court has adopted local rules for permissive electronic filing, then the court may, on the motion of any party or on its own motion, provided that the order would not cause undue hardship or significant prejudice to any party, order all parties in any class action, a consolidated action, a group of actions, a coordinated action, or an action that is complex under rule 3.403 to serve all documents electronically, except when personal service is required by statute or rule. (2) A court may combine an order for mandatory electronic service with an order for mandatory electronic filing as provided in rule 2.253(c). (3) If the court proposes to make any order under (1) on its own motion, the court must mail notice to any parties that have not consented to receive electronic service.

(2) A party's or other person's election to contract with an electronic filing service provider to electronically file and serve documents or to receive electronic service of documents on the party's or other person's behalf does not relieve the party or other person of its duties under (1). (3) An electronic service address is presumed valid for a party or other person if the party or other person files electronic documents with the court from that address and has not filed and served notice that the address is no longer valid. (Subd (g) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2018; adopted as subd (d) effective January 1, 2008; previously relettered as subd (f) effective July 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2011.)

(2) A document may be electronically served on a court if the court consents to electronic service or electronic service is otherwise provided for by law or court order. A court indicates that it agrees to accept electronic service by: (A) Serving a notice on all parties and other persons in the case that the court accepts electronic service. The notice must include the electronic service address at which the court agrees to accept service; or (B) Adopting a local rule stating that the court accepts electronic service. The rule must indicate where to obtain the electronic service address at which the court agrees to accept service.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b)(1)(B). The rule does not prescribe specific language for a provision of a term of service when the filer consents to electronic service, but does require that any such provision be clear. Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address (form EFS-005-CV) provides an example of language for consenting to electronic service. Subdivision (c). The subdivision is applicable only to civil actions as defined in rule 1.6. Penal Code section 690.5 excludes mandatory electronic service in criminal cases. Subdivisions (c)-(d). Court-ordered electronic service is not subject to the provisions in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 requiring that, where mandatory electronic filing and service are established by local rule, the court and the parties must have access to more than one electronic filing service provider.",

(2) Order granting request for confidentiality (A) Applicability (B) Minor's name (i) If the minor is a party to the action, the court must use the initials of the minor or other initials, at the discretion of the court. In addition, the court must use only initials to identify both parties to the action if using the other party's name would likely reveal the identity of the minor.

(f) Procedures to protect confidential information when request is granted (1) If a request for confidentiality is granted in whole or in part, the court, in its discretion, and taking into consideration the factors stated in (g), must ensure that the order granting confidentiality is maintained in the most effective manner by: (A) The judicial officer redacting all information to be kept confidential from all applicable documents; (B) Ordering the requesting party or the requesting party's attorney to prepare a redacted copy of all applicable documents and submit all redacted copies to the court for review and filing; or (C) Ordering any other procedure that facilitates the prompt and accurate preparation of a redacted copy of all applicable documents in compliance with the court's order granting confidentiality, provided the selected procedure is consistent with (g).

(Subd (g) amended effective September 1, 2020. (h) Releasing minor's confidential information (1) em] To respondent Information about a protected minor must be released to the respondent only as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6(v)(4)(A)(ii), limited to information necessary to allow the respondent to respond to the request for the protective order and to comply with the confidentiality order and the protective order. (2) em] To law enforcement Information about a minor must be shared with law enforcement as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6(v)(4)(A)(i) or by court order. (3) To other persons If the court finds it is necessary to prevent harassment or is in the best interest of the minor, the court may release confidential information on the request of any person or entity or on the court's own motion. (A) Request for release of confidential information (i) Any person or entity may request the release of confidential information by filing Request for Release of Minor's Confidential Information (form CH-176) and a proposed, Order on Request for Release of Minor's Confidential Information (form CH-179), with the court.

(B) Opportunity to object (i) The person who made the request for confidentiality has the right to object by filing form CH-178 within 20 days from the date of the mailing of form CH-177 , or verbally objecting at a hearing, if one is held. (ii) The person filing a response must serve a copy of the response (form CH-178) on the person requesting release of confidential information. Service must occur before filing the response form with the court unless the response form contains confidential information. If the response form contains confidential information, service must be done as soon as possible after the response form has been redacted. (iii) If the person who made the request for confidentiality objects to the release of information, the court may set the matter for a closed hearing. (C) Rulings The request may be granted or denied in whole or in part without a hearing. Alternatively, the court may set the matter for hearing on at least 10 days' notice to the person who made the request for release of confidential information and the person who made the request for confidential information. Any hearing must be confidential. (i) Order granting release of confidential information a. The order (form CH-179) granting the release of confidential information must be prepared in a manner consistent with the procedures outlined in (f). b. A redacted copy of the order (form CH-179) must be filed in a public file and an unredacted copy of the order must be filed in a confidential file. c.

Parties may be served in court if present at the hearing. (ii) Order denying request to release minor's confidential information a. The court may deny a request to release confidential information based on the request alone. b. The order (form CH-179) denying the release of confidential information must be filed in a public file and must not include any confidential information. c. Service If the court denies the request for release of information based on the pleadings, the court must mail a copy of form CH-179 to the person who filed form CH-176 and the person who made the request to keep the minor's information confidential. Parties may be served in court if present at the hearing. (iii) If the court finds that the request to release confidential information is insufficiently specific to meet the requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6(v)(4)(C), the court may conduct a closed hearing to determine if there are additional facts that would support granting the request. The court may receive any relevant evidence, including testimony from the person requesting the release of a minor's confidential information, the minor, the legal guardian, the person who requested the restraining order, or other competent witness. (Subd (h) amended effective September 1, 2020.) (i) Protecting information in subsequent filings and other civil cases (1) Filings made after an order granting confidentiality (A) A party seeking to file a document or form after an order for confidentiality has been made must submit the Cover Sheet for Confidential Information (form CH-175) attached to the front of the document to be filed. (B) Upon receipt of form CH-175 with attached documents, the court must: (i) Order a procedure for redaction consistent with the procedures stated in (f); (ii) File the unredacted document in the confidential file pending receipt of the redacted document if the redacted document is not prepared on the same court day; and (iii) File the redacted document in the public file after it has been reviewed and approved by the court for accuracy.

(B) The minor or person making the request for confidentiality and any person who has been served with a notice of confidentiality must submit a copy of the order of confidentiality (form CH-165) in any other civil case with the same parties. (Subd (i) amended effective September 1, 2020.) Rule 3.1161 amended effective September 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 2019. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivisions (a)-(e). The process described in this rule need not be used for minors if the request for confidentiality is merely to keep an address confidential and a petitioning minor has a mailing address which need not be kept private that can be listed on the forms. The restraining order forms do not require the address of a nonpetitioning minor. This rule and rule 2.551 provide a standard and procedures for courts to follow when a request is made to seal a record. The standard as reflected in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6(v)(2) is based on NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. The standard recognizes the First Amendment right of access to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication.",

(Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and July 1, 2007.) (c) Notification of the appeal (1) When a notice of appeal is filed, the superior court clerk must promptly send a notification of the filing to the attorney of record for each party, any unrepresented defendant, the district appellate project, the reviewing court clerk, each court reporter, and any primary reporter or reporting supervisor. The notification must specify whether the defendant filed a statement under (b)(1)(A) and, if so, whether the superior court filed a certificate or an order denying a certificate under (b)(1)(B). (2) The notification must show the date it was sent, the number and title of the case, and the dates that the notice of appeal and any certificate or order denying a certificate under (b)(1)(B) were filed. If the information is available, the notification must also include: (A) The name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and California State Bar number of each attorney of record in the case; (B) The name of the party each attorney represented in the superior court; and (C) The name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of any unrepresented defendant. (3) The notification to the reviewing court clerk must also include a copy of the notice of appeal, any certificate filed under (b)(1), and the sequential list of reporters made under rule 2.950. (4) A copy of the notice of appeal is sufficient notification under (1) if the required information is on the copy or is added by the superior court clerk. (5) The sending of a notification under (1) is a sufficient performance of the clerk's duty despite the discharge, disqualification, suspension, disbarment, or death of the attorney. (6) Failure to comply with any provision of this subdivision does not affect the validity of the notice of appeal. Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2016.) Rule 8.304 amended effective January 1, 2022; repealed and adopted as rule 30 effective January 1, 2004; previously amended and renumbered as rule 8.304 effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2016. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). Penal Code section 1235(b) provides that an appeal from a judgment or appealable order in a \"felony case\" is taken to the Court of Appeal, and Penal Code section 691(f) defines \"felony case\" to mean \"a criminal action in which a felony is charged.\" Rule 8.304(a)(2) makes it clear that a \"felony case\" is an action in which a felony is charged regardless of the outcome of the action . Thus the question whether to file a notice of appeal under this rule or under the rules governing appeals to the appellate division of the superior court (rule 8.800 et seq.) is answered simply by examining the accusatory pleading: if that document charged the defendant with at least one count of felony (as defined in Penal Pen. Code, § 17(a)), the Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction and the appeal must be taken under this rule even if the prosecution did not result in a punishment of imprisonment in a state prison . It is settled case law that an appeal is taken to the Court of Appeal not only when the defendant is charged with and convicted of a felony, but also when the defendant is charged with both a felony and a misdemeanor (Pen. Code, § 691(f)) but is convicted of only the misdemeanor (e.g., People v. Brown (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 169); when the defendant is charged with a felony but is convicted of only a lesser offense (Pen. Code, § 1159; e.g., People v. Spreckels (1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 507); and when the defendant is charged with an offense filed as a felony but punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor, and the offense is thereafter deemed a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17(b) (e.g., People v. Douglas (1999) 20 Cal.4th 85; People v. Clark (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 890). Trial court unification did not change this rule: after as before unification, \"Appeals in felony cases lie to the [C]ourt of [A]ppeal, regardless of whether the appeal is from the superior court, the municipal court, or the action of a magistrate. Cf. Cal. Const. art. VI, § 11(a) [except in death penalty cases, Courts of Appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior courts have original jurisdiction 'in causes of a type within the appellate jurisdiction of the [C]ourts of [A]ppeal on June 30, 1995].\" (\" Recommendation on Trial Court Unification: Revision of Codes \" (July 1998) 28 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1998) pp. 455-456.) Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) reiterates the requirement stated in Penal Code section 1237.5(a) that to challenge the validity of a plea or the admission of a probation violation on appeal under Penal Code section 1237(a), the defendant must file both a notice of appeal and the written statement required by section 1237.5(a) for the issuance of a certificate of probable cause. (See People v. Mendez (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1084, 1098 [probable cause certificate requirement is to be applied strictly].) Subdivision (b)(2) identifies exceptions to the certificate-of-probable-cause requirement, including an appeal that challenges the denial of a motion to suppress evidence under Penal Code section 1538.5 (see People v. Stamps (2020) 9 Cal.5th 685, 694) and an appeal that does not challenge the validity of the plea or the admission of a probation violation (see, e.g., id. at pp. 694-698 [appeal based on a postplea change in the law]; People v. Arriaga (2014) 58 Cal.4th 950, 958-960 [appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate a conviction based on inadequate advisement of potential immigration consequences under Penal Code section 1016.5]; and People v. French (2008) 43 Cal.4th 36, 45-46 [appeal that challenges a postplea sentencing issue that was not resolved by, and as a part of, the negotiated disposition]). Subdivision (b)(2)(C) clarifies that no certificate of probable cause is required for an appeal from an order that, by law, is appealable without a certificate. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, § 1473.7.) Subdivision (b)(3) makes clear that if a defendant raises on appeal an issue that requires a certificate of probable cause, but the defendant does not file the written statement required by Penal Code section 1237.5 or the superior court denies the certificate, then the appeal is limited to issues, such as those identified in subdivision (b)(2), that do not require a certificate of probable cause.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). In subdivision (a)(1), the reference to \"judgment\" is intended to include part of a judgment. Subdivision (a)(1) includes an explicit reference to \"appealable order\" to ensure that litigants do not overlook the applicability of this rule to such orders. Subdivision (c)(2). This subdivision addresses the content of a clerk's notice that a check for the filing fee has been dishonored or that the reviewing court has received a notice of appeal without the filing fee, a certificate of cash payment, or an application for, or order granting, a fee waiver. Rule 8.26(f) addresses what an appellant must do when a fee waiver application is denied. Subdivision (e). Under subdivision (e)(2), a notification of the filing of a notice of appeal must show the date that the clerk sent the document. This provision is intended to establish the date when the 20-day extension of the time to file a cross-appeal under rule 8.108(e) begins to run. Subdivision (e)(1) requires the clerk to send a notification of the filing of the notice of appeal to the appellant's attorney or to the appellant if unrepresented. Knowledge of the date of that notification allows the appellant's attorney or the appellant to track the running of the 20-day extension of time to file a cross-appeal under rule 8.108(e).",

(b) Policies  (1) The brief limits set by rule 8.630 are substantially higher than for other appellate briefs in recognition of the number, significance, and complexity of the issues generally presented in appeals from judgments of death and are designed to be sufficient to allow counsel to prepare adequate briefs in the majority of such appeals. (2) In a small proportion of such appeals, counsel may not be able to prepare adequate briefs within the limits set by rule 8.630. In those cases, necessary additional briefing will be permitted. (3) A party may not file a brief that exceeds the limit set by rule 8.630 unless the court finds that good cause has been shown in an application filed within the time limits set in (d).  (c) Factors considered  The court will consider the following factors in determining whether good cause exists to grant an application to file a brief that exceeds the limit set by rule 8.630: (1) The unusual length of the record. A party relying on this factor must specify the length of each of the following components of the record: (A) The reporter's transcript; (B) The clerk's transcript; and (C) The portion of the clerk's transcript that is made up of juror questionnaires. (2) The number of codefendants in the case and whether they were tried separately from the appellant; (3) The number of homicide victims in the case and whether the homicides occurred in more than one incident; (4) The number of other crimes in the case and whether they occurred in more than one incident; (5) The number of rulings by the trial court on unusual, factually intensive, or legally complex motions that the party may assert are erroneous and prejudicial. A party relying on this factor must briefly describe the nature of these motions; (6) The number of rulings on objections by the trial court that the party may assert are erroneous and prejudicial; (7) The number and nature of unusual, factually intensive, or legally complex hearings held in the trial court that the party may assert raise issues on appeal; and (8) Any other factor that is likely to contribute to an unusually high number of issues or unusually complex issues on appeal. A party relying on this factor must briefly specify those issues.  (d) Time to file and contents of application  (1) An application to file a brief that exceeds the limits set by rule 8.630 must be served and filed as follows: (A) For an appellant's opening brief or respondent's brief: (i) If counsel has not filed an application requesting an extension of time to file the brief, no later than 45 days before the brief is due.

(ii) If counsel has filed an application requesting an extension of time to file the brief, within the time specified by the court in its order regarding the extension of time. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (B) For an appellant's reply brief: (i) If counsel has not filed an application requesting an extension of time to file the brief, no later than 30 days before the brief is due. (ii) If counsel has filed an application requesting an extension of time to file the brief, within the time specified by the court in its order regarding the extension of time. (2) After the time specified in (1), an application to file a brief that exceeds the applicable limit may be filed only under the following circumstances: (A) New authority substantially affects the issues presented in the case and cannot be adequately addressed without exceeding the applicable limit. Such an application must be filed within 30 days of finality of the new authority; or (B) Replacement counsel has been appointed to represent the appellant and has determined that it is necessary to file a brief that exceeds the applicable limit. Such an application must be filed within the time specified by the court in its order setting the deadline for replacement counsel to file the appellant's brief. (3) The application must: (A) State the number of additional words or typewritten pages requested. (B) State good cause for granting the additional words or pages requested, consistent with the factors in (c). The number of additional words or pages requested must be commensurate with the good cause shown. The application must explain why the factors identified demonstrate good cause in the particular case. The application must not state mere conclusions or make legal arguments regarding the merits of the issues on appeal. (C) Not exceed 5,100 words if produced on a computer or 15 pages if typewritten. Rule 8.631 adopted effective January 1, 2008. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). In all cases in which a judgment of death was imposed after a trial that began after January 1, 1997, the record filed with the Supreme Court will be the record that has been certified for accuracy under rule 8.622. In cases in which a judgment of death was imposed after a trial that began before January 1, 1997, the record filed with the Supreme Court will be the certified record under rule 8.625. Subdivision (c)(1). As in guideline 8 of the Supreme Court's Guidelines for Fixed Fee Appointments, juror questionnaires generally will not be taken into account in considering whether the length of the record is unusual unless these questionnaires are relevant to an issue on appeal. A record of 10,000 pages or less, excluding juror questionnaires, is not considered a record of unusual length; 70 percent of the records in capital appeals filed between 2001 and 2004 were 10,000 pages or less, excluding juror questionnaires. Subdivision (c)(5). Examples of unusual, factually intensive, or legally complex motions include motions to change venue, admit scientific evidence, or determine competency. Subdivisions (c)(5)-(8). Because an application must be filed before briefing is completed, the issues identified in the application will be those that the party anticipates may be raised on appeal. If the party does not ultimately raise all of these issues on appeal, the party is expected to have reduced the length of the brief accordingly. Subdivision (c)(7). Examples of unusual, factually intensive, or legally complex hearings include jury composition proceedings and hearings to determine the defendant's competency or sanity, whether the defendant has an intellectual disability, and whether the defendant may be self-represented. Subdivision (d)(1)(A)(ii). To allow the deadline for an application to file an overlength brief to be appropriately tied to the deadline for filing that brief, if counsel requests an extension of time to file a brief, the court will specify in its order regarding the request to extend the time to file the brief, when any application to file an overlength brief is due. Although the order will specify the deadline by which an application must be filed, counsel are encouraged to file such applications sooner, if possible. Subdivision (d)(3). These requirements apply to applications filed under either (d)(1) or (d)(2).",

(c) Copy to the reviewing court The clerk must promptly send the reviewing court a copy of any notice filed under this rule. Rule 8.121 adopted effective January 1, 2008. Advisory Committee Comment The Judicial Council has adopted an optional form- Appellant's Notice Designating Record on Appeal ( form APP-003)-that can be used to provide the notice required by this rule. This rule makes the filing of a notice designating the record an \"act required to procure the record\" within the meaning of rule 8.140(a). Under that rule, a failure to file such a notice triggers the clerk's duty to issue a 15-day notice of default and thereby allows the appellant to cure the default in superior court.

CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT   2025",
    "content": "Rule 3.1385. Duty to notify court and others of settlement of entire case (a) Notice of settlement (1) Court and other persons to be notified If an entire case is settled or otherwise disposed of, each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must immediately file written notice of the settlement or other disposition with the court and serve the notice on all parties and any arbitrator or other court-connected alternative dispute resolution (ADR) neutral involved in the case. Each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must also immediately give oral notice to all of the above if a hearing, conference, or trial is scheduled to take place within 10 days. (2) Compensation for failure to provide notice If the plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief does not notify an arbitrator or other court-connected ADR neutral involved in the case of a settlement at least 2 days before the scheduled hearing or session with that arbitrator or neutral, the court may order the party to compensate the arbitrator or other neutral for the scheduled hearing time. The amount of compensation ordered by the court must not exceed the maximum amount of compensation the arbitrator would be entitled to receive for service as an arbitrator under Code of Civil Procedure section 1141.18(b) or that the neutral would have been entitled to receive for service as a neutral at the scheduled hearing or session. (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1989, July 1, 2001, July 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2006.) (b) Dismissal of case Except as provided in (c) or (d), each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must serve and file a request for dismissal of the entire case within 45 days after the date of settlement of the case. If the plaintiff or other party required to serve and file the request for dismissal does not do so, the court must dismiss the entire case 45 days after it receives notice of settlement unless good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed. (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2009; adopted effective January 1, 1989; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2006.) (c) Conditional settlement (1) Notice If the settlement agreement conditions dismissal of the entire case on the satisfactory completion of specified terms that are not to be performed within 45 days of the settlement, including payment in installment payments, the notice of conditional settlement served and filed by each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must specify the date by which the dismissal is to be filed. (2) Dismissal If the plaintiff or other party required to serve and file a request for dismissal within 45 days after the dismissal date specified in the notice does not do so, the court must dismiss the entire case unless good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed. (3) Hearings vacated (A) Except as provided in (B), on the filing of the notice of conditional settlement, the court must vacate all hearings and other proceedings requiring the appearance of a party and may not set any hearing or other proceeding requiring the appearance of a party earlier than 45 days after the dismissal date specified in the notice, unless requested by a party. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (B) The court need not vacate a hearing on an order to show cause or other proceeding relating to sanctions, or for determination of good faith settlement at the request of a party under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. (4) Case disposition time Under standard 2.2(n)(1)(A), the filing of a notice of conditional settlement removes the case from the computation of time used to determine case disposition time. (Subd (c) amended effective July 1, 2013; adopted effective January 1, 1989; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2006.) (d) Compromise of claims of a minor or disabled person If the settlement of the case involves the compromise of the claim of a minor or person with a disability, the court must not hold an order to show cause hearing under (b) before the court has held a hearing to approve the settlement, provided the parties have filed appropriate papers to seek court approval of the settlement. (Subd (d) adopted effective January 1, 2009.) (e) Request for additional time to complete settlement If a party who has served and filed a notice of settlement under (a) determines that the case cannot be dismissed within the prescribed 45 days, that party must serve and file a notice and a supporting declaration advising the court of that party's inability to dismiss the case within the prescribed time, showing good cause for its inability to do so, and proposing an alternative date for dismissal. The notice and a supporting declaration must be served and filed at least 5 court days before the time for requesting dismissal has elapsed. If good cause is shown, the court must continue the matter to allow additional time to complete the settlement. The court may take such other actions as may be appropriate for the proper management and disposition of the case. (Subd (e) adopted effective January 1, 2009.) Rule 3.1385 amended effective July 1, 2013; adopted as rule 225 effective January 1, 1985; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1989, January 1, 1992, July 1, 2001, July 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2009. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivisions (a) and (b). Amended Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 allows parties to settle a case and agree to have the case dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must follow the procedures outlined in subdivisions (a) and (b) even if the parties settle the case and agree to dismiss under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. Subdivision (c). Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 allows for but does not mandate the dismissal of cases with conditional settlements either upon stipulation of the parties or on the court’s own motion. Subdivision (c) provides an alternative process for cases with a conditional settlement in which dismissal is not sought under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.",

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). This subdivision establishes the standard time for filing a notice of appeal and identifies rules that establish very limited exceptions to this standard time period for cases involving certain postjudgment motions and cross-appeals (rule 8.108), certain expedited appeals under the California Environmental Quality Act (rule 8.702), and appeals under Code of Civil Procedure section 1294.4 of an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration (rule 8.712). Under subdivision (a)(1)(A), a notice of entry of judgment (or a copy of the judgment) must show the date on which the clerk served the document. The proof of service establishes the date that the 60-day period under subdivision (a)(1)(A) begins to run. Subdivision (a)(1)(B) requires that a notice of entry of judgment (or a copy of the judgment) served by or on a party be accompanied by proof of service. The proof of service establishes the date that the 60-day period under subdivision (a)(1)(B) begins to run. Although the general rule on service (rule 8.25(a)) requires proof of service for all documents served by parties, the requirement is reiterated here because of the serious consequence of a failure to file a timely notice of appeal (see subd. (e)). Subdivision (b). See rule 8.25(b)(5) for provisions concerning the timeliness of documents mailed by inmates and patients from custodial institutions. Subdivision (b) is declarative of the case law, which holds that the reviewing court lacks jurisdiction to excuse a late-filed notice of appeal. ( Hollister Convalescent Hosp., Inc. v. Rico (1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 666-674; Estate of Hanley (1943) 23 Cal.2d 120, 122-124.) In criminal cases, the time for filing a notice of appeal is governed by rule 8.308 and by the case law of \"constructive filing.\" (See, e.g., In re Benoit (1973) 10 Cal.3d 72.)",

(2) If an appellant timely appeals from an order granting a motion for new trial, an order granting-within 150 days after entry of judgment-a motion to vacate the judgment, or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the time for any other party to appeal from the original judgment or from an order denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is extended until 20 days after the clerk serves notification of the first appeal. (Subd (g) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2011; adopted as subd (e); previously relettered as subd (f) effective January 1, 2008.) (h) Service; proof of service Service under this rule may be by any method permitted by the Code of Civil Procedure, including electronic service when permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and rules 2.250-2.261. An order or notice that is served must be accompanied by proof of service. (Subd (h) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2011; adopted as subd (f); previously relettered as subd (g) effective January 1, 2008.) Rule 8.108 amended effective January 1, 2016; repealed and adopted as rule 3 effective January 1, 2002; previously amended and renumbered as rule 8.108 effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2008, January 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and January 1, 2015. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivisions (b)-(f) operate only when a party serves and files a \"valid\" motion, election, request, or notice of intent to move for the relief in question. As used in these provisions, the word \"valid\" means only that the motion, election, request, or notice complies with all procedural requirements; it does not mean that the motion, election, request, or notice must also be substantively meritorious. For example, under the rule a timely new trial motion on the ground of excessive damages (Code Civ. Proc., § 657) extends the time to appeal from the judgment even if the trial court ultimately determines the damages were not excessive. Similarly, a timely motion to reconsider ( id ., § 1008) extends the time to appeal from an appealable order for which reconsideration was sought even if the trial court ultimately determines the motion was not \"based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law,\" as subdivision (a) of section 1008 requires. Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) provides that the denial of a motion for new trial triggers a 30-day extension of the time to appeal from the judgment beginning on the date that the superior court clerk or a party serves either the order of denial or a notice of entry of that order. This provision is intended to eliminate a trap for litigants and to make the rule consistent with the primary rule on the time to appeal from the judgment (rule 8.104(a)). Subdivision (c). The Code of Civil Procedure provides two distinct statutory motions to vacate a judgment: (1) a motion to vacate a judgment and enter \"another and different judgment\" because of judicial error ( id ., § 663), which requires a notice of intention to move to vacate ( id ., § 663a); and (2) a motion to vacate a judgment because of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, which requires a motion to vacate but not a notice of intention to so move ( id ., § 473, subd. (b)). The courts also recognize certain nonstatutory motions to vacate a judgment, e.g., when the judgment is void on the face of the record or was obtained by extrinsic fraud. (See 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, §§ 222-236, pp. 726-750.) Subdivision (c) is intended to apply to all such motions. In subdivision (c) the phrase \"within the time prescribed by rule 8.104 to appeal from the judgment\" is intended to incorporate in full the provisions of rule 8.104(a). Under subdivision (c)(1), the 30-day extension of the time to appeal from the judgment begins when the superior court clerk or a party serves the order denying the motion or notice of entry of that order. This provision is discussed further under subdivision (b) of this comment. Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d)(1) provides an extension of time after an order denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict regardless of whether the moving party also moved unsuccessfully for a new trial. Subdivision (d) further specifies the times to appeal when, as often occurs, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is joined with a motion for new trial and both motions are denied. Under subdivision (b), the appellant has 30 days after notice of the denial of the new trial motion to appeal from the judgment. Subdivision (d) allows the appellant the longer time provided by rule 8.104 to appeal from the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, subject to that time being further extended in the circumstances covered by subdivision (g)(2). Under subdivision (d)(1)(A), the 30-day extension of the time to appeal from the judgment begins when the superior court clerk or a party serves the order denying the motion or notice of entry of that order. This provision is discussed further under subdivision (b) of this comment. Subdivision (e). The scope of subdivision (e) is specific. It applies to any \"appealable order,\" whether made before or after judgment (see Code Civ. Proc., § 904.1, subd. (a)(2)-(12)), but it extends only the time to appeal \"from that order.\" The subdivision thus takes no position on whether a judgment is subject to a motion to reconsider (see, e.g., Ramon v. Aerospace Corp. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1236-1238 [postjudgment motion to reconsider order granting summary judgment did not extend time to appeal from judgment because trial court had no power to rule on such motion after entry of judgment]), or whether an order denying a motion to reconsider is itself appealable (compare Santee v. Santa Clara County Office of Education (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 702, 710-711 [order appealable if motion based on new facts] with Rojes v. Riverside General Hospital (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1151, 1160-1161 [order not appealable under any circumstances]). Both these issues are legislative matters. Subdivision (e) applies only when a \"party\" makes a valid motion to \"reconsider\" an appealable order under subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008; it therefore does not apply when a court reconsiders an order on its own motion ( id., subd. (d)) or when a party makes \"a subsequent application for the same order\" ( id., subd. (c)). The statute provides no time limits within which either of the latter events must occur. Under subdivision (e)(1), the 30-day extension of the time to appeal from the order begins when the superior court clerk or a party serves the order denying the motion or notice of entry of that order. The purpose of this provision is discussed further under subdivision (b) of this comment. Among its alternative periods of extension of the time to appeal, subdivision (e) provides in paragraph (2) for a 90-day period beginning on the filing of the motion to reconsider or, if there is more than one such motion, the filing of the first such motion. The provision is consistent with subdivision (c)(2), governing motions to vacate judgment; as in the case of those motions, there is no time limit for a ruling on a motion to reconsider. Subdivision (g). Consistent with case law, subdivision (g)(1) extends the time to appeal after another party appeals only if the later appeal is taken \"from the same order or judgment as the first appeal.\" ( Commercial & Farmers Nat. Bank v. Edwards (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 699, 704.) The former rule (former rule 3(c), second sentence) provided an extension of time for filing a protective cross-appeal from the judgment when the trial court granted a motion for new trial or a motion to vacate the judgment, but did not provide the same extension when the trial court granted a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. One case declined to infer that the omission was unintentional, but suggested that the Judicial Council might consider amending the rule to fill the gap. ( Lippert v. AVCO Community Developers, Inc. (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 775, 778 & fn. 3.) Rule 8.108(e)(2) fills the gap thus identified. Subdivision (h). Under subdivision (h), an order or notice that is served under this rule must be accompanied by proof of service. The date of the proof of service establishes the date when an extension of the time to appeal begins to run after service of such an order or notice.",

A document is also a notice, order, judgment, or other issuance by the court. A document may be in paper or electronic form. (2) \"Electronic service\" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (3) \"Electronic transmission\" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (4) \"Electronic notification\" has the same meaning as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. (5) \"Electronic service address\" means the electronic address at or through which the party or other person has authorized electronic service. (6) An \"electronic filer\" is a party or other person filing a document in electronic form directly with the court, by an agent, or through an electronic filing service provider. (7) \"Electronic filing\" is the electronic transmission to a court of a document in electronic form. For the purposes of this chapter, this definition concerns the activity of filing and does not include the processing and review of the document, and its entry into the court records, which are necessary for a document to be officially filed. (8) An \"electronic filing service provider\" is a person or entity that receives an electronic filing from a party or other person for retransmission to the court or for electronic service on other parties or other persons, or both. In submission of filings, the electronic filing service provider does so on behalf of the electronic filer and not as an agent of the court.

If the party files a motion or an application to seal within 10 days or such later time as the court has ordered, these documents are to remain conditionally under seal until the court rules on the motion or application and thereafter are to be filed as ordered by the court. (4) Lodging of record pending determination of motion or application The party requesting that a record be filed under seal must lodge it with the court under (d) when the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for not lodging it or the record has previously been lodged under (3)(A) (i). Pending the determination of the motion or application, the lodged record will be conditionally under seal.

This notification must be received within 10 days of the order denying the motion or application to seal, unless otherwise ordered by the court. On receipt of this notification, the clerk must unseal and file the record. If the moving party does not notify the court within 10 days of the order, the clerk must (1) return the lodged record to the moving party if it is in paper form or (2) permanently delete the lodged record if it is in electronic form. (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2004, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2016.) (c) References to nonpublic material in public records A record filed publicly in the court must not disclose material contained in a record that is sealed, conditionally under seal, or subject to a pending motion or an application to seal. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2004.) (d) Procedure for lodging of records (1) A record that may be filed under seal must be transmitted to the court in a secure manner that preserves the confidentiality of the records to be lodged. If the record is transmitted in paper form, it must be put in an envelope or other appropriate container, sealed in the envelope or container, and lodged with the court. (2) The materials to be lodged under seal must be clearly identified as \"CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL.\" If the materials are transmitted in paper form, the envelope or container lodged with the court must be labeled \"CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL.\" (3) The party submitting the lodged record must affix to the electronic transmission, the envelope, or the container a cover sheet that: (A) Contains all the information required on a caption page under rule 2.111; and (B) States that the enclosed record is subject to a motion or an application to file the record under seal. (4) On receipt of a record lodged under this rule, the clerk must endorse the affixed cover sheet with the date of its receipt and must retain but not file the record unless the court orders it filed.

(e) Order (1) If the court grants an order sealing a record and if the sealed record is in paper format, the clerk must substitute on the envelope or container for the label required by (d)(2) a label prominently stating \"SEALED BY ORDER OF THE COURT ON (DATE ),\" and must replace the cover sheet required by (d)(3) with a filed-endorsed copy of the court's order. If the sealed record is in electronic form, the clerk must file the court's order, maintain the record ordered sealed in a secure manner, and clearly identify the record as sealed by court order on a specified date. (2) The order must state whether-in addition to the sealed records-the order itself, the register of actions, any other court records, or any other records relating to the case are to be sealed. (3) The order must state whether any person other than the court is authorized to inspect the sealed record. (4) Unless the sealing order provides otherwise, it prohibits the parties from disclosing the contents of any materials that have been sealed in anything that is subsequently publicly filed. (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2004, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2016.) (f) Custody of sealed records Sealed records must be securely filed and kept separate from the public file in the case. If the sealed records are in electronic form, appropriate access controls must be established to ensure that only authorized persons may access the sealed records. (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2004.) (g) Custody of voluminous records If the records to be placed under seal are voluminous and are in the possession of a public agency, the court may by written order direct the agency instead of the clerk to maintain custody of the original records in a secure fashion. If the records are requested by a reviewing court, the trial court must order the public agency to deliver the records to the clerk for transmission to the reviewing court under these rules. (h) Motion, application, or petition to unseal records (1) A sealed record must not be unsealed except on order of the court. (2) A party or member of the public may move, apply, or petition, or the court on its own motion may move, to unseal a record. Notice of any motion, application, or petition to unseal must be filed and served on all parties in the case. The motion, application, or petition and any opposition, reply, and supporting documents must be filed in a public redacted version and a sealed complete version if necessary to comply with (c). (3) If the court proposes to order a record unsealed on its own motion, the court must give notice to the parties stating the reason for unsealing the record. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, any party may serve and file an opposition within 10 days after the notice is provided and any other party may file a response within 5 days after the filing of an opposition. (4) In determining whether to unseal a record, the court must consider the matters addressed in rule 2.550(c)-(e). (5) The order unsealing a record must state whether the record is unsealed entirely or in part. If the court's order unseals only part of the record or unseals the record only as to certain persons, the order must specify the particular records that are unsealed, the particular persons who may have access to the record, or both. If, in addition to the records in the envelope, container, or secure electronic file, the court has previously ordered the sealing order, the register of actions, or any other court records relating to the case to be sealed, the unsealing order must state whether these additional records are unsealed.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Agreement  An agreement reached in a conference must be signed by the parties and filed.

(c) Proceedings after conference  (1) Unless allowed by a filed agreement, no matter recited in a statement under (a)(1) or discussed in a conference under (a)(2) may be considered in any subsequent proceeding in the appeal other than in another conference.

(Cf. rule 3.1380(c) [pretrial settlement conference statement must be served on each party].) The service requirement is not intended to prohibit the presiding justice from ordering the parties to submit additional, confidential material in appropriate cases.  Subdivision (d).   If a prehearing conference is ordered before the due date of the appellant's opening brief, the time to file the brief is not   extended   but   tolled,   in order to avoid unwarranted lengthening of the briefing process. For example, if the conference is ordered 15 days after the start of the normal 30-day briefing period, the rule simply   suspends   the running of that period; when the period resumes, the party will not receive an automatic extension of a full 30 days but rather the remaining 15 days of the original briefing period, unless the period is otherwise extended. Under subdivision (d) the tolling period continues \"until the date [the Court of Appeal] sends notice that the conference is  concluded\"   (italics added).

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.) (b) Agreement An agreement reached in a conference must be signed by the parties and filed. Unless the Court of Appeal orders otherwise, the agreement governs the appeal. (c) Proceedings after conference (1) Unless allowed by a filed agreement, no matter recited in a statement under (a)(1) or discussed in a conference under (a)(2) may be considered in any subsequent proceeding in the appeal other than in another conference. (2) If settlement is addressed at the conference, other than an inquiry solely about the parties' interest in settlement, neither the presiding officer nor any court personnel present at the conference may participate in or influence the determination of the appeal. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2016.) (d) Time to file brief The time to file a party's brief under rule 8.212(a) is tolled from the date the Court of Appeal sends notice of the conference until the date it sends notice that the conference is concluded. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.) Rule 8.248 amended effective January 1, 2016; repealed and adopted as rule 21 effective January 1, 2003; previously amended and renumbered as rule 8.248 effective January 1, 2007. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a)(1) requires each party to serve any statement it files. (Cf. rule 3.1380(c) [pretrial settlement conference statement must be served on each party].) The service requirement is not intended to prohibit the presiding justice from ordering the parties to submit additional, confidential material in appropriate cases. Subdivision (d). If a prehearing conference is ordered before the due date of the appellant's opening brief, the time to file the brief is not extended but tolled, in order to avoid unwarranted lengthening of the briefing process. For example, if the conference is ordered 15 days after the start of the normal 30-day briefing period, the rule simply suspends the running of that period; when the period resumes, the party will not receive an automatic extension of a full 30 days but rather the remaining 15 days of the original briefing period, unless the period is otherwise extended. Under subdivision (d) the tolling period continues \"until the date [the Court of Appeal] sends notice that the conference is concluded\" (italics added). This provision is intended to accommodate the possibility that the conference may not conclude on the date it begins. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 Whether or not the conference concludes on the date it begins, subdivision (d) requires the clerk/executive officer of the Court of Appeal to send the parties a notice that the conference is concluded. This provision is intended to facilitate the calculation of the new briefing due dates.",

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2021; previously amended effective January 31, 1997, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Notice of availability; parties' request  (1)   Local policy to be adopted and posted  Each trial court must adopt and post in the clerk's office a local policy enumerating the departments in which the services of official court reporters are normally available, and the departments in which the services of official court reporters are not normally available during regular court hours. If the services of official court reporters are normally available in a department only for certain types of matters, those matters must be identified in the policy. (2)   Publication of policy  The court must publish its policy in a newspaper if one is published in the county. Instead of publishing the policy, the court may: (A) Send each party a copy of the policy at least 10 days before any hearing is held in a case; or (B) Adopt the policy as a local rule. (3)   Requests for official court reporter for civil trials and notices to parties  Unless the court's policy states that all courtrooms normally have the services of official court reporters available for civil trials, the court must require that each party file a statement before the trial date indicating whether the party requests the presence of an official court reporter. If a party requests the presence of an official court reporter and it appears that none will be available, the clerk must notify the party of that fact as soon as possible before the trial. If the services of official court reporters are normally available in all courtrooms, the clerk must notify the parties to a civil trial as soon as possible if it appears that those services will not be available. (4)   Notice of nonavailability of court reporter for nontrial matters  If the services of an official court reporter will not be available during a hearing on law and motion or other nontrial matters in civil cases, that fact must be noted on the court's official calendar.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Party may procure reporter or request reporter if granted fee waiver  If the services of an official court reporter are not available for a hearing or trial in a civil case, a party may: (1) Arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter, whom the court must appoint unless there is good cause shown to refuse to do so. It is that party's responsibility to pay the reporter's fee for attendance at the proceedings, but the expense may be recoverable as part of the costs, as provided by law; or (2) If the party has been granted a fee waiver, request that the court provide an official reporter for attendance at the proceedings. The court must provide an official reporter if the party has been granted a fee waiver and if the court is not electronically recording the hearing or trial. (A) The request should be made by filing a   Request for Court Reporter by a Party with a Fee Waiver   (form FW-020). If the requesting party has not been granted a fee waiver, a completed   Request to Waive Court Fees   (form FW-001 or form FW-001-GC in guardianship or conservator cases) must be filed at the same time as the request for court reporter.

(Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (e) Definitions As used in this rule and in Government Code section 68086: (1) \"Civil case\" includes all matters other than criminal and juvenile matters. (2) \"Official reporter\" and \"official reporting services\" both include an official court reporter or official reporter as those phrases are used in statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 269 and 274c and Government Code section 69941; and include an official reporter pro tempore as the phrase is used in Government Code section 69945 and other statutes, whose fee for attending and reporting proceedings is paid for by the court or the county, and who attends court sessions as directed by the court, and who was not employed to report specific causes at the request of a party or parties. \"Official reporter\" and \"official reporting services\" do not include official reporters pro tempore employed by the court expressly to report only criminal, or criminal and juvenile, matters. \"Official reporting services\" include electronic recording equipment operated by the court to make the official verbatim record of proceedings where it is permitted.

Advisory Committee Comment CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 Under rule 3.866(9), the complaint proceedings covered by this rule include proceedings to address inquiries as well as complaints (i.e., to unwritten as well as written communications indicating that a mediator may have violated a provision of the rules of conduct). Subdivision (a). See Evidence Code sections 1115 and 1119 concerning the scope and types of mediation communications protected by mediation confidentiality. Rule 3.871 is intended to supplement the confidentiality of mediation communications established by the Evidence Code by ensuring that disclosure of information or records about a complaint proceeding does not reveal confidential mediation communications. Rule 3.871 is not intended to supersede or abrogate the confidentiality of mediation communications established by the Evidence Code. Subdivision (b). Private meetings, or \"caucuses,\" between a mediator and subgroups of participants are common in court- connected mediations, and it is frequently understood that these communications will not be disclosed to other participants in the mediation. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.854(c).) It is important to protect the confidentiality of these communications in complaint proceedings so that one participant in the mediation does not learn what another participant discussed in confidence with the mediator without the consent of the participants in the caucus communication. Subdivisions (c)-(e). The provisions of (c)-(e) that authorize the disclosure of information and records related to complaint proceedings do not create any new exceptions to mediation confidentiality. Although public disclosure of information and records about complaint proceedings that do not reveal mediation communications may be authorized under (d), information and records that would reveal mediation communications may be publicly disclosed only as required by law (e.g., in response to a subpoena or court order) and consistent with the statutes and case law governing mediation confidentiality. A person who is knowledgeable about California's mediation confidentiality laws should determine whether the disclosure of mediation communications is required by law. Evidence Code sections 915 and 1040 establish procedures and criteria for deciding whether information acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his or her duty is subject to disclosure. These sections may be applicable or helpful in determining whether the disclosure of information or records acquired by judicial officers, court staff, and other persons in the course of a complaint proceeding is required by law or should be authorized in the discretion of the presiding judge.",

The waiver of court fees and costs is called an \"initial\" waiver because, under Government Code section 68630 and following, any such waiver may later be modified, terminated, or retroactively withdrawn if the court determines that the applicant was not or is no longer eligible for a waiver. The court may, at a later time, order that the previously waived fees be paid. Subdivision (b)(1). If an applicant is requesting waiver of both Court of Appeal fees, such as the fee for filing the notice of appeal, and superior court fees, such as the fee for preparing, certifying, copying, and transmitting the clerk's transcript, the clerk of the superior court may ask the applicant to provide two signed copies of Request to Waive Court Fees (form FW-001). Subdivision (e). The parties in an appeal may also ask the superior court to waive the deposit required under Government Code section 68926.1 and the fees under rule 8.122 for preparing, certifying, copying, and transmitting the clerk's transcript to the reviewing court and to the requesting party.",

Introduction This Trial Court Records Manual (TCRM) has been developed by court administrators for court administrators and is published under the direction of the Judicial Council of California. The vision of the court administrators and Judicial Council staff who drafted the TCRM is to encourage and embrace input and participation from trial court leaders and subject matter experts in every court so that the TCRM is not only a reference manual of laws and rules governing court records management but also a repository for our best ideas and programs. This manual is not considered final or complete; additional content will be drafted for subsequent versions and distributed to trial court leaders for comment as those versions become available. As the Judicial Council adopts, and the trial courts begin to implement, new policies for the creation, maintenance, retention, and destruction of electronic records, the TCRM seeks to address the issues and challenges that trial courts will encounter with archival and current paper records, as well as to describe the new policies, business practices, and technology considerations that will lay a solid foundation for managing electronic records in the future. As the trial courts’ business model changes with the advent of new technologies, courts are encouraged to develop strategic solutions that will position them to adapt to emerging trends in paperless records management. To assist users in distinguishing between mandatory requirements and optional features of court records management programs, this icon precedes sections containing optional ideas, programs, and best industry practices. Sections not preceded by this icon contain mandatory requirements. Sections containing mandatory requirements typically contain links to the relevant statutes or rules. This manual will be revised and updated periodically. Users are encouraged to submit in writing records management questions and suggestions for improving the TCRM to: TCRM@jud.ca.gov or Court Executives Advisory Committee c/o Judicial Council of California Leadership Services Division, Judicial Council and Trial Court Leadership 455 Golden Gate Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102-3688 2 1.1 Background The Judicial Council of California began developing and maintaining an overall records management framework for California courts to satisfy the needs of the courts for case processing and of historians and archivists for historical and research purposes served by court records, as well as the expectations of the public and litigants to provide reasonable confidentiality of court records. Many of the existing statutes, rules of court, and standards include permissive minimums for court records retention and other options for court records management that allow courts significant latitude in applying them. For many years, the management of trial court records has been costly and cumbersome because of several statutory and operational factors. These factors include the cost of transporting, preserving, and storing paper files and converting them to microfilm or microfiche; the outdated technologies allowed by statute to manage nonpaper records; the lack of staff resources dedicated to managing records; inadequate storage space near the courthouse to enable convenient access to records; and mandates for notification and destruction of records that are impractical and time-consuming. The path to the current edition has had many twists and turns. Prior to unification, trial court records were maintained by the county clerk, who served, by law, as the clerk of court. Municipal and justice court records were the responsibility of each court’s clerk. Over time, the clerk of court duties were transferred to the trial court executive officers. This was essentially complete across the state in 2000, when the trial courts were unified. However, at this point, there needed to be a merger of the records management systems of the former municipal courts and the (now unified) superior courts. Shortly after unification, primary funding for trial courts was shifted from the counties to the state. In addition to changing the source of funding, the change expanded the discretion of each trial court as to how to manage its records in terms of staffing, equipment, and, to a lesser extent, facilities. All of these transitions have changed the opportunities and challenges facing trial courts in establishing and maintaining an appropriate records management program. The next stage of court records management involves the transition from paper records to records that are created and may exist only in electronic form. This involves both case management systems and document management systems containing document images. Some information in the future may exist only in electronic form and may consist only of data in fields of a case management system and not as a form readily converted to paper. A comprehensive records management system must contemplate and enable the shift to electronic records. In December 2009, the Judicial Council of California’s Court Executives Advisory Committee and Court Technology Advisory Committee cosponsored a proposal for Judicial Council–sponsored legislation to amend Government Code sections 68150 and 68151 pertaining to the creation, maintenance, retention, and destruction of trial court records. The 3 proposed amendments were intended to give more latitude to the trial courts to manage and retain court records using modern technologies and to transfer the oversight of such activities from the Legislature to the Judicial Council and the trial courts. The court records legislation was introduced as Assembly Bill 1926 (Evans) in 2010. It amended the law on court records management, effective January 1, 2011, to authorize the council to adopt rules to establish guidelines for the creation, maintenance, reproduction, and preservation of court records. The changes to the Government Code required the adoption of new California Rules of Court to establish standards and guidelines for the creation, maintenance, reproduction, and preservation of trial court records. In October 2010, the Judicial Council adopted new rules 10.850 and 10.854, and amended rule 10.855. Rule 10.850 references the existing Government Code section 68151 on the definition of “court records.” Rule 10.854 directs Judicial Council staff, in collaboration with trial court presiding judges and court executives, to develop and distribute standards and guidelines for managing trial court records by creating a TCRM. The rule also provides direction for the content of the TCRM and mandates its periodic update. Rule 10.855 was modified to include requirements in the TCRM for court records preserved as part of the superior court records sampling program.1 The new and amended rules became effective on January 1, 2011. On the same date, the initial version of this manual became effective. 1.2 Purpose of Records Management The provision of a complete, accurate, and accessible court record, created and available in a timely manner, fulfills one of the judiciary’s basic roles. The court record not only provides a record of the court’s decisions but also educates the public and establishes societal norms for behavior governed by the law. The purpose of developing a TCRM is to assist the trial courts in establishing a comprehensive records management program that meets the expectations of the courts and the public regarding this fundamental role. The establishment and continued operation of a comprehensive records management program is the responsibility of the court’s executive officer. The National Association of Court Management (NACM) Core Competency Curriculum Guidelines on Essential Components identifies what court executives should know and be able to do regarding the court record. The key abilities are described as follows:  Manage the court record-keeping function to produce a complete, accurate, and timely record of judicial actions and decisions. 1 The Judicial Council subsequently amended rule 10.855, effective July 1, 2016, to revise the superior court records sampling program, and effective January 1, 2018, to remove a reporting requirement. Additional information about the new sampling program is available in Chapter 11.1.1 of this manual. 4  Establish court records management policies and practices, including records preparation, records retention, public access, and privacy protections. A comprehensive records management program covers the creation, maintenance, retention, and destruction of trial court records. Each component may have several elements and objectives. The CREATION of the court record involves two sets of information. One set includes documents and other information provided by the parties to aid the court in making its decisions, for example, pleadings, motions, exhibits, and so forth. The litigants, the appellate courts, and the public must be able to see all the information the court considered in making its decision, except what has been sealed or is subject to rules protecting the confidentiality of the information. The second set is the documentation of what the court did and decided. This includes matters related to calendaring and case management, as well as decisions of the court and juries. For litigants and the public to know what they can, and cannot, do, they need clear information about what the court found the law to be and how it was applied in this case. The MAINTENANCE of the court record addresses the continued existence and accessibility of the record. The record must be kept in a manner that ensures its completeness and availability both during the life of an active case and after it is closed, where the result may still be relevant to the parties and the public. It must also be kept in a manner that allows easy and convenient access to those wanting to see it. The court should be able to find the record easily when the record is needed. Making copies of the record should also be convenient and inexpensive. Finally, the format in which the record is kept should allow ready access over time, despite changes in technology, in particular, obsolescence of equipment and software required to access electronic forms of a record. Another aspect of maintenance is preserving the record’s integrity; the court record should be the whole record and nothing but the record. The system for maintaining court records should minimize the risk of misfiling, loss, or damage of the court record or any of its parts. Finally, good records management involves controlling who has access to the record or its component parts. There may be portions of the record that, by law or judicial decision, are accessible only to certain individuals, parties, or groups of individuals based on their role in the justice system. A good records management program should provide convenient and timely access to those allowed to see information and prevent access by those not authorized to see it. The RETENTION of the court record relates to how long it must be available to the public. Some court records must be retained indefinitely; others have a limited “shelf life” and need not be retained. 5 The DESTRUCTION of the court record is the final stage of a records management program. When the existence of a court record is no longer required, based on passage of time or a policy decision, the record should be properly destroyed. Whether the record ceases to exist, or becomes accessible only to certain groups, is a policy decision that the records management program must correctly implement. The goal of this TCRM is to provide direction to the court executive and staff on ways to develop and improve their records management system to fulfill the objectives of faithfully executing all custodial responsibilities pertaining to the court record. 1.3 Purpose of the Manual The purpose of the TCRM is twofold. First and foremost, it contains the statutory and rule requirements with which all trial courts must comply to meet minimum standards to execute their important responsibilities pertaining to managing paper and electronic court records. Second, the TCRM is intended to be a resource guide for court administrators and records staff to help them develop records management programs that best serve their local courts. It includes a broad, though perhaps not exhaustive, list of topics that all courts are encouraged to address to ensure that they have comprehensive and effective local records management programs. The optimal way to use the TCRM is in electronic form, as there are hyperlinks to reference materials, statutes, and other source documents throughout this publication. Judicial Council staff will make every effort to regularly refresh and update links so that the TCRM is a current and relevant resource for records management staff. In addition to providing a resource that will contain all the relevant statutes, rules, requirements, industry standards, and many best practices for court records management, the TCRM will also include a retention and destruction table for court records that is organized in a simple, readable format and includes links to the underlying authority for record retention in every case type. 1.4 Life Cycle of a Record Courts often make the fundamental error of viewing records management only as the sampling, archiving, and destroying of case files in accordance with various statutes and rules of court. This manual is predicated on an expanded definition of records management that encompasses the complete life cycle of court documents from initial filing to final storage and destruction. As documents travel down this path, they will need to be transported to various court locations and viewed by multiple staff members, parties to the case, and others for various purposes. Archiving and destruction is just one step in the process. 6 Records management typically begins with document management. A comprehensive and effective records management program addresses the numerous issues and questions that arise in the life cycle of court documents. Here are just a few examples:  How are documents to be captured and processed when initially filed?  Who will need to access them at various points in the adjudication process?  What method will be used to organize, store, and retrieve documents as cases are processed and disposed?  What resources are necessary to track and manage individual documents and case file locations and security?  How are electronic technologies used to access documents in place of the movement and viewing of physical files? Courts that develop clear and comprehensive answers to these issues and questions are well positioned to have an effective document management system. The manner in which documents are captured and managed at the beginning and middle portions of their life cycle can often determine the ease and efficiency by which they are finally archived and destroyed. More importantly, extensive savings in staff time and financial resources can be achieved through a well-designed, comprehensive documents management program that also enables greater access to court records and services by staff, judicial officers, case parties, and other members of the general public. Records Life Cycle 7 1.5 Key Definitions Court Record Any document, paper, or exhibit filed in an action or proceeding; any order or judgment of the court; and any item listed in Government Code section 68151(a), excluding any reporter’s transcript for which the reporter is entitled to receive a fee for any copy. The term does not include the personal notes or preliminary memoranda of judges or other judicial branch personnel, statutorily mandated reporting between or within government entities, judicial administrative records, court case information, or compilations of data drawn from court records where the compilations are not themselves contained in a court record. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.502(3).) Electronic Record A court record that requires use of an electronic device to access. The term includes both a record that has been filed electronically and an electronic copy or version of a record that was filed in paper form. The term does not include a court record that is maintained only on microfiche, paper, or any other medium that can be read without the use of an electronic device. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.502(6).) Records Management The systematic control of recorded information required to operate a court’s business, including creation, active maintenance and use, inactive storage, and final disposition. 8 2. Statutes and Rules of Court Governing Trial Court Records Management This section lists the principal statutes and rules of court that relate to trial court records. 2.1 California Government Code Sections 68150 to 68153 Government Code sections 68150 through 68153 prescribe how trial court records are to be maintained and preserved, specify how long different types of records must be preserved, and provide procedures for the destruction of records. 2.1.1 Signatures on Electronically Created Court Documents Government Code section 68150(g) provides that any notice, order, judgment, decree, decision, ruling, opinion, memorandum, warrant, certificate of service, writ, subpoena, or other legal process or similar document issued by a trial court or judicial officer of a trial court may be signed, subscribed, or verified using a computer or other technology. Section 6.2.1 of this manual provides standards and guidelines for signing, subscribing, and verifying court documents by electronic means. Section 68511.2 Government Code section 68511.2 provides that the Judicial Council shall provide by rule for the photographic, microphotographic, mechanical, or electronic entry, storage, and retrieval of court records. 2.2 California Rules of Court General Provision for Trial Court Records Rule 2.400.

Records Management Administration 3.1 Application of Standards The TCRM sets forth standards and guidelines for court records maintained of the California trial courts. As previously noted, the TCRM will be periodically updated to reflect changes in statutes, rules of court, or technology that affect the creation, maintenance, retention, and destruction of court records. Except for technical changes, corrections, or minor substantive changes not likely to create controversy, proposed revisions to the TCRM will be circulated to the trial courts for comment before the TCRM is updated or revised. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 10.854(c), courts will be notified of any changes in standards or guidelines, including all those pertaining to the permanent retention of records. Each trial court must develop records management practices consistent with minimum standards authorized in statutes and rules of court, as delineated in the TCRM. Moreover, trial courts are also encouraged to review guidelines described in the TCRM and develop local programs that reflect these policies and practices. Standards and guidelines are intended to lead to more efficient and uniform practices among trial courts to ensure better protection and preservation of and improved public access to trial court records. 3.2 Responsibility for Effective Records Management The trial court executive officer, as part of the enumerated duties in California Rules of Court, rule 10.610, and Government Code sections 69840 through 69848, shall oversee the creation, maintenance, retention, and destruction of trial court case records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules of court, and guidance provided in the TCRM. The court executive officer may delegate these duties to subordinate staff members who serve as records managers. 3.3 Duties and Responsibilities of Records Managers Trial courts have developed many effective records management programs and practices. For the purposes of this manual, the duties of effective records managers have been identified and may include the following:  Plan for the management and control of records;  Recommend procurement of records management equipment and supplies;  Investigate and recommend new technologies;  Implement standard procedures; 11  Conversion and transfer of paper records to other media, and establish and oversee the primary and backup storage systems for these records;  Develop disaster recovery programs in the event that primary data systems become damaged or inoperable;  Maintain the inventory of records;  Manage records destruction programs, which includes ensuring that appropriate notices of destruction are prepared and disseminated by mail or publication, monitoring the destruction of records, validating records destruction, and obtaining certificates of destruction from qualified service providers;  Research new and emerging technologies that are designed to assist organizations with records management;  Monitor inventory and maintain security at off-site storage; and  Train subordinates and representatives of related entities in records management. 12 4. Creation, Filing, and Retrieval of Court Records Records management is a specialized field of court administration involving determinations about how records will be organized, categorized, and stored, and in what format (paper or electronic) they will be maintained. Establishing an efficient system to create, file, and retrieve court records involve careful planning to ensure productive workflow. This includes:  Developing clear protocols on how records are created;  Devising case type and numbering classification systems that convey meaningful information to those who access the records;  Deciding how records will be organized in paper and electronic filing systems;  Determining the best methods for tracking the movement of records within the court and among court facilities; and  Researching and selecting the proper equipment (shelving, tracking applications, scanners) and supplies (file folders, labels, bar codes). 4.1 Court Record Creation Process One of the most basic and critical functions performed by trial courts is the creation and maintenance of the case record. The case record consists of documents filed by attorneys, self-represented litigants, local justice agencies, and other case parties who submit documents to the court. In some instances, courts also create and file documents that become part of the case record. This section is intended to provide court staff with suggested guidance regarding the creation and maintenance of case records that are submitted by litigants, their attorneys, and others involved in cases. This section does not address case records prepared by the courts themselves. 4.1.1 Filing Papers in Court: Methods of Filing Effective Filing Date – Currently, courts receive legal documents for filing and processing through various means including:  Over the counter;  By mail;  By drop box;  By e-filing, directly or through an e-filing service provider (EFSP);  As an attachment to email (often referred to as e-delivery); and  By fax. Government Code section 69846.5 states, “The clerk of the superior court shall endorse on each paper filed with the court the day, month, and year it is filed.” The issue of when a 13 paper is deemed “filed” depends on the applicable law for the mode of delivery and the type of filing. To assist courts in determining the effective filing date for court documents, the following is a list of applicable statutes and California Rules of Court for documents received through various means. Note that the filing date depends on when the document was received by the court, and not on when the court completed processing of the document. It takes a finite amount of time for the clerk’s office to review a document, determine whether it meets filing criteria as to form and attachments, check the fee payment, if any, enter data into a register of action or case management system, and scan the document, if scanning is done. These steps may take several minutes, spread over several hours. As a result, the document processing may not be complete on the same day the document is received. Nonetheless, the filing date should be the date received.  Filing in person – Rule 1.20 of the California Rules of Court: “Unless otherwise provided, a document is deemed filed on the date it is received by the court clerk.”  Filing by mail – Rule 1.20 of the California Rules of Court: “Unless otherwise provided, a document is deemed filed on the date it is received by the court clerk.”  Filing at drop box – Government Code section 68108(b) and rule 2.210(b)–(c) of the California Rules of Court. Government Code section 68108(b) states: “A drop box shall provide for an automated, official time and date stamping mechanism or other means of determining the actual date on which a document was deposited in the drop box.” Rule 2.210(b) of the California Rules of Court states: “Any document deposited in a court’s drop box up to and including 4:00 p.m. on a court day is deemed to have been deposited for filing on that day. A court may provide for same-day filing of a document deposited in its drop box after 4:00 p.m. on a court day. If so, the court must give notice of the deadline for same-day filing of a document deposited in a drop box.” Rule 2.210(c) of the California Rules of Court states: “Any document deposited in a court’s drop box is deemed to have been deposited for filing on the next court day if: [¶] (1) It is deposited on a court day after 4:00 p.m. or after the deadline for same-day filing if a court provides for a later time; or [¶] (2) It is deposited on a judicial holiday.”  Filing electronically – Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and rule 2.259 of the California Rules of Court. 14 If electronic filing is permissive, Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b)(3) and California Rules of Court, rule 2.253(a) apply. Section 1010.6(b)(3) states: “Any document received electronically by the court between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day shall be deemed filed on that court day. Any document that is received electronically on a noncourt day shall be deemed filed on the next court day.” Rule 2.253(a) states: “A court may permit parties by local rule to file documents electronically in any types of cases subject to the conditions in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6 and the rules in this chapter [i.e., rules 2.250–2.261].” If electronic filing is mandatory, Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b)(3) and California Rules of Court, rule 2.253(b)(6) apply. Section 1010.6(b)(3) states: “Any document received electronically by the court between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day shall be deemed filed on that court day. Any document that is received electronically on a noncourt day shall be deemed filed on the next court day.” Rule 2.253(b)(6) states: “The effective date of filing any document received electronically is prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. This provision concerns only the effective date of filing. Any document that is received electronically must be processed and satisfy all other legal filing requirements to be filed as an official court record.” The California Rules of Court also recognize that a technical problem with a court’s electronic filing system may warrant deeming certain late-filed documents as filed when the attempt was made to file the documents rather than when the documents were actually received by the court. Addressing this point, rule 2.259(c) states: “If a technical problem with a court’s electronic filing system prevents the court from accepting an electronic filing on a particular court day, and the electronic filer demonstrates that he or she attempted to electronically file the document on that day, the court must deem the document as filed on that day. This subdivision does not apply to the filing of a complaint or any other initial pleading in an action or proceeding.” These laws apply to both e-filed documents and e-delivered documents as the statute contemplates the method of transmission (“electronically”), not the form of the document or message.  Filing by fax – Rules 1.20, 2.303, and 2.304 of the California Rules of Court. Under rule 2.303(a), “[a] party may transmit a document by fax to a fax filing agency for filing with any trial court.” Under rule 2.304(a), “[a] party may file by fax directly to any court that, by local rule, has provided for direct fax filing.” Under rule 1.20, “[u]nless otherwise provided, a document is deemed filed on the date it is received by the court clerk.” (See also, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.304(d)–(e) [specifying how failures of transmission and rejection of credit card charges are to be handled when a party directly fax files with a court].) 15  Filing on a court holiday – Code of Civil Procedure section 134(d): “The fact that a court is open on a judicial holiday shall not make that day a nonholiday for purposes of computing the time required for the conduct of any proceeding nor for the performance of any act. Any paper lodged with the court at a time when the court is open pursuant to subdivision (c), shall be filed by the court on the next day that is not a judicial holiday, if the document meets appropriate criteria for filing.” Courts are encouraged to consult these statutes and rules when assessing their filing processes and procedures and to seek assistance from local counsel or from the Judicial Council’s Legal Services office if they have specific questions or issues in this regard. Filing redacted documents – Rule 1.201 of the California Rules of Court. Rule 1.201(a) directs that certain sensitive personal information—specifically, social security numbers and financial account numbers—must be redacted or excluded from documents filed with the court, with certain exceptions. The responsibility for excluding or redacting information from documents filed with the court rests solely with the parties and their attorneys, not the clerk. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.201(b).) “The court clerk will not review each pleading or other paper for compliance with this provision.” ( Ibid .) Filing records that are confidential as a matter of law – For direction in dealing with confidential records, see section 10.3.1, “Confidential Records,” and Appendix 1, below. (For more information about confidential trial court records, see also the Privacy Resource Guide: For The California Trial And Appellate Courts and the Judicial Branch (the Privacy Resource Guide), section 2.1.1.) Depending on the law, entire cases, categories of cases, or individual documents in a case may be confidential. Some case files and documents may be permanently classified as confidential while others may be confidential only for a specified period of time. Filing records under seal – For direction in dealing with court files and documents ordered sealed, see section 10.3.2, “Sealed Records,” below (and Privacy Resource Guide, section 2.1.2). Also, you may consult the following California Rules of Court:  Filing records under seal, generally – rule 2.551(a): “A record must not be filed under seal without a court order.”  Rule 2.551(d) describes procedures for conditionally lodging documents that may be filed under seal.  Rule 2.551(f) directs that “[s]ealed records must be securely filed and kept separate from the public file in the case. If the sealed records are in electronic form, appropriate access controls must be established to ensure that only authorized persons may access the sealed records.”  Filing records under seal, in a False Claims Act case – rules 2.570–2.571. 16 Types of Documents Maintained in Case Files and Elsewhere (Filed Documents and Other Documents Submitted, Lodged, or Deposited with the Court) “The clerk of the superior court shall safely keep or dispose of according to law all papers and records filed or deposited in any action or proceedings before the court.” (Gov. Code, § 69846.) Official court documents used in the adjudication of actions or proceedings, such as complaints, petitions, answers, responses, and motions with or without attached exhibits, are filed with the court and included in the register of actions, if kept. In addition, parties lodge, deposit, or submit various other documents that are not officially filed and entered into the register of actions. There are several types of documents that are accorded different treatments based on statutes and rules. To assist courts in determining the appropriate manner of handling these types of documents, the following information is provided:  Administrative records – “Court records” include administrative records “filed in an action or proceeding.” (Gov. Code, § 68151(a)(2).) In addition, some statutes and rules specifically require particular administrative records to be “lodged” with the court. (See, e.g., on CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) actions, Pub. Resources Code, § 21167.6(b)(1) [providing for the lodging of CEQA records by the public agency]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.2206 [“The party preparing the administrative record must lodge it with the court and serve it on each party . . . ”].)  Arrest Warrants with No Existing Related Case – Law enforcement and other agencies can request that the court issue an arrest warrant. Often there is not yet a filing or case involving the proposed arrestee, and there may never be a court filing. Consequently, the court will have arrest warrants issued by a judge that are not associated with any case at the time of issuance. Because arrest warrants may not be associated with a particular case, it is important for the court to have a specific procedure for identifying, storing, and retrieving every warrant. In this system, arrest warrants should typically be indexed by the name of the person to be arrested. There are several options for where to maintain arrest warrants, given the possibility that a case will be filed related to a warrant. When a case is subsequently filed, it can be very problematic for court staff to identify the existence of an associated arrest warrant, let alone find the warrant and place it in or link it to the case file. One option is to have court staff attempt to match “orphan” arrest warrants with new cases as they are filed, though this may be a time-consuming activity for relatively infrequent occurrences. A second option is to leave warrants in the location where they were 17 originally placed and for court staff to locate a warrant when an issue about the warrant is raised in a particular case. While this involves less work for the clerk’s office, being done only when needed, it still places the burden on the clerk to find the arrest warrant. Another option would be for the court to indicate to parties that if they raise an issue about the warrant, they should contact the agency that originally requested the warrant to produce the warrant. This will lessen the burden on court staff to spend resources locating the warrant in a particular case. If the agency cannot find the warrant and supporting documents, or there is a question about the validity of the documents offered, the court can then direct the clerk to produce the documents maintained by the court. The arrest warrants should be retained for the period provided by statute, as they document the decisions of a judicial officer, which may be litigated in a subsequently filed case. (See Gov. Code, § 68152(c)(12) [retention period].) Certain arrest records may be confidential. See section 10.3.1, “Confidential Records, and Appendix 1.  Court transcripts – Some court reporter’s transcripts, such as preliminary hearing transcripts and transcripts prepared as part of an appellate record, may be included in the case file. Although part of the case file, these transcripts are subject to different requirements from other records in the case file with respect to copying and electronic access. Courts generally may not provide or sell a copy of a transcript to a party or other person without an additional fee being paid to the court reporter. (Gov. Code, § 69954.) The requirement that a court’s electronic records generally must be “reasonably available to the public in some form” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.503(a)(1)) explicitly does not apply to copies of reporter transcripts for which a reporter is entitled to receive a fee. (See id ., rule 2.502(3), (6) [excluding such transcripts from the definitions of “court record” and “electronic record” for purposes of the rules on public access to electronic trial court records].) If a request is received for a copy of a reporter’s transcript, the requester should be directed to contact the court reporter who reported the hearing. (See Gov. Code, § 69954.)  Exhibits – see section 5.1.4 and section 7.  Juror Records – see section 5.1.5, and sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2.  Lodged Records – see section 5.1.3.  Mandatory settlement conference statements – These statements are submitted to the court rather than filed and should be transmitted to the judicial officer who will conduct the conference. California Rules of Court, rule 3.1380(c) states, “No later than five court days before the initial date set for the settlement conference, each 18 party must submit to the court and serve on each party a mandatory settlement conference statement ... .”  Prefiled Records – see section 5.1.2.  Proposed orders – Proposed orders in civil cases are governed by rule 3.1312 of the California Rules of Court. These are generally submitted to the court rather than filed and should be transmitted to the appropriate judicial officer for further action. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1312(b).) Special procedures exist for handling proposed orders that are submitted electronically—two versions of the proposed order must be submitted to the court: (1) a Portable Document Format (PDF) version attached to a completed Proposed Order (Cover Sheet) (form EFS-020), which is filed, and (2) a version in an editable word-processing format, which is made available for the judge’s use. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1312(c).)  Search warrants – See discussion and options under “Arrest Warrants,” above. Because search warrants may not be associated with a particular case, it is important for the court to have a specific procedure for identifying, storing, and retrieving every search warrant. For example, search warrants could be indexed by the location of the place to be searched. Certain search warrants or information contained in a search warrant may be confidential. See section 10.3.1, “Confidential Records,” and Appendix 1.  Trial subpoenas – See section 5.3, “Subpoenaed Records and Documents.”  Wills – Original wills must be delivered to the court under Probate Code section 8200. Section 8200(a) states: “Unless a petition for probate of the will is earlier filed, the custodian of a will shall, within 30 days after having knowledge of the death of the testator . . . [¶] (1) [d]eliver the will . . . to the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the estate of the decedent may be administered.” An original will is lodged or deposited with the court rather than filed; however, a copy of the will must be attached to the petition for probate filed with the court. (See Prob. Code, § 8002(b)(1).) Letters and other correspondence – Generally, correspondence sent to the court should be placed in the same physical file with the other documents in a case (pursuant to Gov. Code, § 69846) but is not entered into the register of actions. (See Gov. Code, § 69845 [register of actions].) The correspondence should be organized separately from the filed documents. The correspondence may be marked with a “received” stamp and placed in the file in chronological order. Courts maintaining records in electronic form should consider establishing a process or procedure for 19 addressing correspondence received in the case, separate from the documents that are filed. Some correspondence may require special treatment. For example: Correspondence requesting action – Correspondence that seeks a particular action should be processed by the court or judicial officer, as appropriate. Thus, letters containing proposed orders should be transmitted to the appropriate judicial officer. A request for copies of court documents should be processed by the court if the requesting party has paid the costs of copying and mailing. Complaints against judicial officers should be processed in accordance with the court’s procedures. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.703 [subordinate judicial officers] and rule 10.746 [temporary judges].) Ex parte communications – Correspondence that seeks to communicate with the judicial officer handling a matter, without a copy being served on other parties that have appeared in the action, should not be placed in the file where it might be seen by a judicial officer involved in the case. (See Cal. Code Judicial Ethics, canons 3B(7), 6D(2) [judges, temporary judges, referees, and court-appointed arbitrators “shall not . . . permit . . . or consider ex parte communications”].) Instead, courts should develop procedures whereby such communications are returned to the submitting party with an explanation as to why the document was not placed in the case file. (But see Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.1200–3.1207 [governing ex parte applications and orders in civil cases].) 4.1.2 Filing Papers in Court: Form and Format Requirements Form and format of papers filed in the trial courts – Rules 2.100–2.116 of the California Rules of Court prescribe the form and format of papers presented for filing in the trial courts. These rules preempt any local rules on the form and format of papers. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.100(a).) The form and format requirements in rules 2.100–2.116 generally do not apply to Judicial Council forms, local court forms, or forms for juvenile dependency proceedings. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.119.) Court’s acceptance or rejection of papers for filing – The clerk of the court generally must not accept papers for filing that do not comply with the form and format requirements in rules 2.100–2.116 of the California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.118.) But, the clerk must not reject a paper for filing solely on the ground that (1) it is handwritten or hand- printed, (2) the handwriting or hand printing on the paper is in a color other than black or blue-black, (3) the font size is not exactly the point size required by rules 2.104 and 2.110(c) on papers submitted electronically as PDFs, or (4) the first page does not contain an attorney’s or a party’s fax number or email address. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.118(a)–(b).) For good cause, the court may permit the filing of papers that do not conform to the form and 20 format requirements. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.118(c).) While the responsibilities of the clerk under (a) and (b) are ministerial, the good cause determination to permit filing under (c) is a judicial function. Duty to file documents – “If a document is presented to the clerk’s office for filing in a form that complies with the rules of court, the clerk’s office has a ministerial duty to file it. (See Carlson v. Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1276.) Even if the document contains defects, the clerk’s office should file it and notify the party that the defect should be corrected. (See Rojas [ v. Cutsforth (1998)] 67 Cal.App.4th [774,] 777.)” ( Voit v. Superior Court (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1287.) Effect of failure to submit civil case cover sheet – The first paper filed in a civil action or proceeding must be accompanied by a completed Civil Case Cover Sheet (form CM-010). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.220.) But if a party that is required to provide a cover sheet under rule 3.220 or a similar local rule fails to do so or provides a defective or incomplete cover sheet at the time the party’s first paper is submitted for filing, the clerk must still file the paper; failure to file a cover sheet may subject a party or a party’s counsel to monetary sanctions. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.220(c).) 4.1.3 Filing Papers in Court: Role of Civil Fees and Fee Waivers Effects of Failure to Pay All Required Filing Fees – The effect on filing of a failure to pay filing fees depends, among other things, on:  Whether the party is required to pay a filing fee;  Whether an application for a fee waiver was submitted;  Whether the party paid no fee at all;  Whether the amount tendered was less than the amount of the required fee;  Whether the amount was tendered by a check that was returned for insufficient funds; and  Whether a credit card payment was rejected. The following additional information is provided regarding filing fees and fee waivers:  Schedule of fees – A statewide civil fee schedule is available online at http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/StatewideCivilFeeSchedule . Many courts also prepare their own fee schedules. The schedules list the documents which, upon filing, require payment of a fee and the amount of the fee. Note: (1) Certain documents do not require payment of a fee to be filed (see, e.g., Gov. Code, § 70617(b)); (2) State and local government entities are generally exempt from paying civil filing fees (see Gov. Code, § 6103); for some other exemptions from fees for court services, see Gov. Code, § 70633). 21  No fee paid – If a party is required to pay a fee for filing a particular document and no fee is tendered, the court may reject the filing unless the party has submitted a fee waiver application with its papers or a fee waiver has previously been granted in the action.  Fee waivers – Government Code sections 68630–68641; California Rules of Court, rules 3.50–3.58. The clerk shall accept all applications for an initial fee waiver for filing. If an applicant submits an application without providing all required information to complete the form, the clerk may request that the applicant supply the omitted information, but shall not refuse to file the application, or refuse to file any pleadings accompanying the application, on the ground that the fee has not been paid. (Gov. Code, § 68634(b).)  Amount tendered is less than the amount of the required filing fee – Code of Civil Procedure section 411.21. If a complaint or other first paper, except in an unlawful detainer action, is accompanied by a check in an amount less than the required fee, the clerk shall accept the paper for filing, but shall not issue a summons until the court receives full payment of the required fee. The court, by mail, shall notify the party tendering the check that (1) the check was made out for an amount less than the required filing fee, (2) the administrative charge specified in the statute has been imposed to reimburse the court for the costs of processing the partial payment and providing the notice, and (3) the party has 20 days from the date of mailing of the notice within which to pay the remainder of the required fee and the administrative charge, except where a hearing is scheduled before the 20-day period expires. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.21(a).) The clerk shall void the filing if the party who tendered a check in an amount less than the required filing fee or on whose behalf a check in an amount less than the required filing fee was tendered has not paid the full amount of the fee and the administrative charge within 20 days of the date on which the notice was mailed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.21(b).) Any filing voided by the section may be disposed of immediately after the 20 days have elapsed without preserving a copy in the court records, notwithstanding Government Code section 68152. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.21(b); see id ., 411.21(a)– (e) for more details; for information concerning the administrative fee, see id ., § 411.20(g).)  Check for fee amount is returned for insufficient funds – Code of Civil Procedure section 411.20. If the clerk accepts for filing a complaint or other first paper, or any subsequent filing, and payment is made by check that is later returned without payment, the clerk shall, by mail, notify the party who tendered the check that (1) the check has been returned without payment, (2) the administrative charge specified in 22 the statute has been imposed to reimburse the court for the costs of processing the returned check and providing the notice, and (3) the party has 20 days from the date of mailing of the notice within which to pay the filing fee and the administrative charge, except where a hearing is scheduled before the 20-day period expires. The notice also shall state that the administrative charge and the filing fee shall be paid in cash, by certified check, or by other means specified by the court, but not by traveler's check or personal check. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.20(a).) The clerk shall void the filing if the party who tendered a returned check or on whose behalf a returned check was tendered has not paid the full amount of the fee and the administrative charge by a means specified in the statute within 20 days of the date on which the notice was mailed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.20(b).) Any filing voided by this section can be disposed of immediately after the 20 days have elapsed without preserving a copy in the court records, notwithstanding Government Code section 68152. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.20(b); see id ., § 411.20(a)– (f) for more details; for information concerning the administrative fee, see id ., § 411.20(g).)  Credit card payment is rejected – Credit card payments rejected by the processing center should be treated as any other failure to pay a filing fee. In most cases, the person submitting the payment (e.g., at the counter or over the Internet) is immediately notified of the rejection and can provide payment in some other manner. If a request for credit card payment is received through the mail but rejected by the processing center, the court should notify the submitting party of the rejection using the same procedures utilized when a check is rejected by the bank as described in the previous section of this manual. The only exception is that there should be no administrative charge added to the amount owing.  Represented party fails to remit payment to an electronic filing service provider – If the attorney of record representing a party fails to pay filing fees owed to an electronic filing service provider for five days after notice to the attorney of record, the electronic filing service provider may notify the clerk, and the clerk may notify the attorney of record that the attorney may be sanctioned by the court for nonpayment of fees. The court may sanction the attorney of record if the fees to the electronic service provider remain unpaid 20 days after notice by the clerk. (Code Civ. Proc., § 411.20.5.) 4.2 Numbering Schematic for Court Records A case numbering system should be rational and meaningful and should convey information to court staff and other users that will help them understand how court 23 records are organized. The numbering system must ensure that each case has a unique number to minimize confusion and facilitate locating and filing the case and its associated documents. The case number may include key information that includes year of filing, case type, and a sequential identifying number. For example, a case number may consist of: 1. Court jurisdiction identifier; 2. The last two digits of the filing year; 3. An alpha or numeric code to designate case type (e.g., “CR” for criminal, “CV” for civil); 4. A continuous sequentially assigned number related to that case type; and 5. Additional identifiers as suffixes, such as court branches or designations for multiple defendants, based on local needs. For example, using this common numbering scheme, the 345th criminal case, with two defendants, filed in the Superior Court of Marin County in 2010 might generate the following unique case numbers: 21-10-CR0000345A for the first defendant and 21-10-CR0000345B for the second defendant. 4.3 Filing Systems for Court Records Maintained in Paper Format Effective filing systems for paper records determine how records will be organized, categorized, accessed, and stored. The most efficient filing systems ensure that records can be retrieved at the right time, at the right place, at the lowest possible cost. This includes determining what kind of shelving will be used, who will have access to the record storage areas, how records will be accounted for when not shelved, and how records will be located when they cannot be readily retrieved. Records managers must first decide how to organize paper records on file shelves or in cabinets. There are several filing systems that may be considered, but all systems have advantages and disadvantages. Ideally, the type of filing system(s) selected will be compatible with the records organized in the system. Below are descriptions of three commonly used filing systems. 4.3.1 Numerical Filing Systems by Case Numbers Court records may be arranged in numerical sequence, although filing systems that are strictly numerical are uncommon in organizing case records, because of the volume, complexity, and variety of case types. (These systems are more useful for administrative records [procurements, accounts payable, etc.], as these kinds of records are less complex and less variable.) 24 A numerical arrangement orders records from the lowest number to the highest. This method is also often an indicator of which files are the oldest (the lower-numbered files) and which are the most current (the higher-numbered files). While these filing systems are simple and easy to learn, and make detecting misfiles more readily apparent, a disadvantage of this system is that new records are being shelved only at one end of the system. As old records are purged, staff must shift and reshelf remaining records to make room for new ones. A benefit of these systems is that a numerical scheme is easier to comprehend than an alphanumeric filing scheme and may result in fewer misfiles. 4.3.2 Alphanumeric Filing Systems by Case Numbers An alphanumeric arrangement combines alpha characters and digits to designate case records and determine how they will be shelved. Alphanumeric filing systems are commonly used for court case records. There are two ways in which these systems are organized. Typically, alpha characters are used to signify case types and often precede sequential case numbers. In some filing systems, all cases with the same case type are grouped together and then filed sequentially by case number. For example, all civil cases with alpha designations of “CV” are in one grouping, while family law cases with designations of “FL” are in a separate section of the filing system. An alternative approach is that all alpha designations are commingled and share the sequential filing number sequence. In these systems, the filing year is an important feature of the case number, to avoid replicating case numbers over time. For example, all civil, probate, and family law cases, with prefixes of “CV,” “PR,” and “FL,” respectively, share a numbering sequence and are filed together in the same system. Alphanumeric filing systems are often configured to reflect the way the trial court organizes functions in the clerk’s offices or courthouse. Because alphanumeric systems are more complex than simple numeric systems, the opportunity for misfiles is increased. 4.3.3 Terminal Digit Filing Systems by Case Numbers Terminal digit filing systems are also used in many organizations, including trial courts. In a terminal digit system, the focus for shelving records is only on the numerical portion of a case number. Cases are not filed sequentially; instead, every file is shelved based on an “addressing” scheme that is associated with the case number. In terminal digit systems, the numbers are read from right to left and divided into three sections. In the terminal digit file there are 100 primary sections ranging from 00 to 99. In this arrangement, the last two digits are the primary unit used for filing; records are ordered by the last two digits, then the middle two digits, and finally by the first two digits. Another way to conceptualize this system is to treat case numbers as analogous to the postal designations of street, city, and zip code. For example, case number 135640 would be divided into three parts: “13” representing the “street,” “56” representing the “city,” and “40” 25 representing the “zip code.” The entire filing system is divided into 100 areas, or zip codes, starting with section “00” and ending with section “99.” Then each zip code is divided into 100 subsections, or cities, from “00” to “99.” Finally, each city subsection is divided again into subsections, or streets, from “00” to “99.” For case number 135640, the last two digits of the case number, “40,” is analogous to the zip code designation and provides the general area of the filing system in which the case will be shelved. The middle two digits, “56,” narrows down the “city” location in section “40” where the record will be shelved. Finally, the first two digits, “13,” represent the “street” in the “city” that is the record’s final destination. 13 – 56 – 40 street city zip code While this system requires more training initially, once staff is trained, terminal digit virtually eliminates the need to shift and reshelf records, as new records are interspersed among existing records and purged records are removed from throughout the system. 4.4 Electronic Format Filing Protocols 4.4.1 E-Filing Overview In a period of increasingly tight budgets and ever-expanding caseloads, courts across the country have looked at electronic filing as a way to reduce the considerable demands of handling physical case files and the long-term costs of storing official documents. In theory, electronic filing of pleadings and other court papers will finally make it possible to move toward the ideal of a “less paper” courthouse, thus realizing a wide range of potential spin-off benefits for litigants, judges, lawyers, court administrators, and the general public. The idea that a court can operate electronically is not new. Quite a few courts have successfully implemented electronic records processes that use imaging technology to “scan” paper documents and convert them to electronic files that are stored in sophisticated document management systems. For example, the federal bankruptcy court is almost completely paperless after years of transition for the court, attorneys, and other users. 26 E-filing is the next generation of electronic records processing. Instead of delivering or mailing a paper document to the court, litigants and lawyers send an electronic version of the information or document to the court, via the Internet. Advantages of e-filing:  Improved legal processes, as judges and lawyers learn to take advantage of the universal availability and ease of sharing electronic documents.  Enhanced public safety arising from electronic service of and instantaneous access to court orders (including domestic violence orders of protection) and warrants.  Shifting of data entry from the clerk to the filer, thus reducing court staff data entry time and potential for data entry errors.  Savings for the court of costs incurred to convert most documents from paper to electronic form.  Expedited processing time by eliminating the time required for mailing or personal delivery of pleadings and other documents.  Increased efficiency and reduced cost from the ultimate reduction or elimination of handling and storing paper case files in courts, lawyers’ offices, and official archives.  “Greener” filing business processes enabled by e-filing. 4.5 Court Record Location Tracking 4.5.1 Paper Record Tracking There are few court activities that are more frustrating and wasteful of staff resources than searching for lost court records. By implementing effective tracking protocols and, depending on the court’s needs, by investing in tracking technologies (bar codes, RFID,2 etc.), significant staff time can be saved and deployed in more productive activities. Automated tracking systems that use bar code or radio frequency technology to track the movement of court records are helpful in managing the check-in and check-out process. Automated tracking systems also can produce reports to assist records staff in locating missing records. Periodic physical inventory of all court records not on file shelving or in file rooms or warehouses can often uncover missing records and restore them to oversight by records custodians. As described below, there are several common methods for monitoring the whereabouts of court records. 2 See discussion of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) on the next page, below. 27 Out Cards Records custodians are encouraged to use an “out-card” system to track all records removed from file shelves or storage facilities. When a record is retrieved, an out-card can be inserted in the location from which the record was removed. Out-cards may include the name and contact information of the staff person who removed the record, the date the record was removed, and the destination of the record (courtroom, public viewing area, other court facility, etc.). Out-card systems are “low tech,” are inexpensive to implement, and can be effective, especially in small courts with only one facility. Bar Code Technology Automated tracking systems that use bar codes are another option in managing the check-in and check-out process for court records and in monitoring the movement of records. In a bar code system, every file folder is labeled with a bar code (every folder in a multivolume case record receives its own bar code). Key locations in the courthouse (judicial departments, public viewing areas, the accounting unit, off-site facilities, etc.) are also assigned a bar code and placed on a list at each bar code scanning location. Each bar code is associated in a tracking database with its corresponding folder or location. Then, as file folders are checked out of the filing system, the bar codes are scanned by records staff, as well as the destination of the file folder. For example, if a bar coded “civil file” was being routed to a specific judicial department, the folder and the department would be scanned so that the file would be tracked to the judicial department. Bar code systems are relatively inexpensive, as they are not complex. A tracking application with a relational database and scanning stations and/or portable scanning wands are all that is needed to implement such a system. Bar code technology has been in use for many years and is very reliable. However, a major challenge for a court implementing the tracking system is in determining the number of locations that will be tracking destinations. The tendency to have every desk be a destination may sound like a good idea, but in practice may be too onerous for staff members who are processing hundreds of files a day. Developing a list of key locations that helps narrow the search in the event there is a lost file is typically the most advantageous. Another key decision is which staff person will be responsible for tracking the file to the next location—the staff person who is passing on a file or the staff person who is receiving it. Since the identity of the person scanning the file will be retained by the tracking system, it is critical to gain cooperation from all staff to use the technology with every file. Automated tracking systems also can produce reports to show what was requested, when, and by whom. Many scanning systems have battery-powered portable scanners that records management staff can carry around the courthouse to periodically update the location of every file that is not in the filing area. RFID Technology Radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) is a wireless noncontact system that uses radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an 28 object, for automatic identification and tracking. RFID systems are a “high tech” and more expensive method for locating and tracking files. Like bar code technology, RFID tags are created and attached to file folders. RFID tags are “active” bar codes that can exchange information with a networked system to track every file. RFID tracking solutions save time by providing continuous, automatic tracking of files and other items as they move around the courthouse and pass through an area where an RFID reader is present. Like a traditional bar code, an RFID tag must be read. However, an RFID tag does not need to be physically scanned. It can be detected and read as it passes by a reader that can be mounted on a wall up to 25 feet away. Staff members are relieved of the responsibility to scan files, as the records are automatically monitored at all times by the technology, and their locations are typically updated in real time. Records staff can locate files at any time by checking the tracking database online. This technology has been cost prohibitive in the past, but in recent years the cost has been coming down. In situations where it is affordable, this technology could be beneficial for small to medium court systems. 4.5.2 Electronic File Tracking and Security In the V3 (civil, small claims, probate, and mental health) case management system (CMS), which some courts use, the “Track Case Files” function describes the activities involved in changing the location of physical case files. This process incorporates maintaining a “chain of custody” during the location change of physical case files and defining who has ownership of a physical case file at a particular place, time, and location. Case files may be tracked to separate locations (e.g., a facility or department) within the court’s jurisdiction. Case files may also be located out of a court’s jurisdiction, in the event there is a change of venue. The “Track Case Files” function also defines the activities involved in creating and tracking the case file, including the initial and subsequent volumes, as well as defining an indirect association between volumes and documents within the volumes. The V3 CMS user may choose to update the location of case files within the context of a case (selecting associated volumes) or outside the context of a case (in the scenario where a request may span multiple cases based on a court calendar or any other criteria). 29 5. Record Classification California statutes define the characteristics of (or requirements for) court case records, typically at the case type level. These requirements are contained in numerous code sections in law. To assist records managers in determining the correct classification of (and handling requirements for) court case records, these characteristics and special records management directives are included in TCRM section 11.4, “Schedule of Records Retention and Destruction and Special Case Type Characteristics.” It is important to recognize distinctions between case categories and case types . For records management purposes, sometimes case records are organized by case category , i.e., they are grouped together by common attributes, such as operational or statistical reporting needs (e.g., case category = criminal). Case records can also be organized by subcategory or case type , i.e., they may be grouped by other common attributes, such as retention periods or other statutory requirements (e.g., case type = felony). The case categories and the characteristics for each case type are described in section 11.4, “Schedule of Records Retention and Destruction and Special Case Type Characteristics.” Case type characteristics may include (1) whether records are available to the public or confidential; (2) whether confidentiality requirements apply for the life of the case record or for a limited time; and (3) whether special destruction, deletion, or redaction requirements apply to some portion of the case record. 5.1 Standard Record Classifications 5.1.1 Case Record Classification The California judicial branch maintains an electronic statistical reporting system called the Judicial Branch Statistical Information System (JBSIS). JBSIS defines and collects summary information for each major case-processing area of a court and makes court data available via the JBSIS data warehouse. JBSIS was created to inform the Judicial Council on its policy and budgetary decisions, provide management reports for court administrators, and allow the Judicial Council to fulfill its legislative mandate to report on the business of the courts. The JBSIS system comprises 10 report types, which are broad case categories (e.g., Family Law report 6a) made up of a collection of individual case types (e.g., Paternity). The standard case record classifications contained in the JBSIS system include the following: 30 Appeals A classification category for cases appealed to a California Court of Appeal or the California Supreme Court, as well as to the appellate division of the superior court. Civil Cases A broad classification category for trial court caseload involving lawsuits brought to redress private wrongs, such as breach of contract or negligence, or to enforce civil remedies, such as compensation, damages, and injunctions. The civil limited category captures cases for which the petitioner/plaintiff is seeking relief that does not exceed $25,000. (Code Civ. Proc., § 85(a).) The civil unlimited category captures cases for which the petitioner/plaintiff is seeking relief of more than $25,000. It also includes complex litigation and small claims appeals. Family Law Cases A major classification category of cases involving family actions, such as marital actions (e.g., dissolution), custody matters, family support, parental rights, and adoption. Felony Cases A criminal case type that involves an offense punishable by death, imprisonment in a state prison, or imprisonment in a county jail under the provisions of Penal Code section 1170(h). (See Pen. Code, § 17(a).) Juvenile Justice Cases A broad classification of cases in which a minor is alleged to have violated a law or ordinance defining crime. (See Welf. & Inst. Code, § 602.) The purpose of proceedings in this classification is to provide for the safety and protection of both the public and the minor, and to provide the minor with resources and support to address the issues that led to involvement in the juvenile justice system. (See, e.g., id ., §§ 202, 1700.) Juvenile Dependency Cases A broad classification of cases filed on behalf of a minor by a county child welfare agency. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 325; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 5.502(31), (39), 5.520(b)(1).) The purpose of this type of proceeding is to provide safety and protection for children who are currently being physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, being neglected, being exploited, or are at risk of such harm. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 300.2.) Mental Health Cases A broad classification of cases in which a trial court is asked to make a determination about a person’s need for involuntary mental health treatment. This may occur where:  A person has been certified for involuntary intensive treatment because the person is alleged to be dangerous or to be gravely disabled as a result of a mental health 31 disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism (see, e.g., Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5250 et seq.; id ., § 5270.15 et seq.);  A person is considered for civil commitment or extension of a civil commitment (see, e.g., Pen. Code, § 1026 et seq. [not guilty by reason of insanity], § 1370 et seq. [incompetent to stand trial], § 1600 et seq. [outpatient placement and revocation], § 2962 et seq. [mentally disordered offender]; Welf. & Inst. Code, § 709 [minor who is the subject of juvenile proceedings, incompetent], § 5300 et seq. [imminently dangerous persons], § 6300 et seq. [mentally disordered sex offenders; repealed prospectively only, see Stats. 1981, ch. 928, §§ 3–4, p. 3485]), § 6500 et seq. [developmentally disabled persons dangerous to self or others], § 6600 et seq. [sexually violent predators];  An order is sought directing a person to obtain assisted outpatient treatment for a mental illness (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5345 et seq.);  An order is sought requiring medical treatment for an involuntarily detained person (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5325 et seq.);  A person is the subject of a conservatorship petition based on alleged grave disability as a result of a mental health disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5350 et seq.); or  A person or law enforcement agency seeks a determination about whether the person may own or possess a firearm or other deadly weapon (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 8100 et seq.). Misdemeanor and Infraction Cases Misdemeanors are crimes or public offenses that are not felonies and are not classified as infractions. (Pen. Code, § 17(a).) Infractions are a category of crimes, other than felonies and misdemeanors, that are punishable by a fine or other penalty but not by imprisonment. (Pen. Code, §§ 17(d), 19.6–19.8.) Probate Cases A broad classification of cases in which a trial court is asked to make a legal determination about:  The disposition or transfer of a dead person’s property (Prob. Code, § 8000 et seq.);  The appointment of a conservator for an adult ( id ., § 1800 et seq.);  The appointment of a guardian for a child ( id ., § 1500 et seq.);  The internal affairs or existence of a trust ( id ., § 17200 et seq.); and  Other matters governed by the Probate Code. Small Claims A broad classification category for small claims cases that encompass a wide variety of civil case types in which the remedy sought is $5,000 or less, or, in actions brought by a natural person, $10,000 or less. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 116.220–116.221.) 32 5.1.2 Prefiled Records This category includes search warrants, probable cause declarations, wiretaps, grand jury indictments, and investigative reports provided pursuant to Penal Code section 1318.1 recommending whether a criminal defendant should be released on his or her own recognizance. Retention, destruction, and special characteristics of some of these records are described in section 11.4. 5.1.3 Lodged Records A lodged record is a record that is temporarily placed or deposited with the court, but not filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(b)(3).) Some records may be lodged with the court for long periods of time, such as wills and codicils. (See, e.g., Prob. Code, § 8200 et seq.) Other records may be lodged with the court only while awaiting a judicial ruling and, following the ruling, may or may not be returned to the depositor. (See, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(6).) 5.1.4 Exhibits A document or object formally presented to the court as evidence. Exhibits management is described in section 7. 5.1.5 Juror Records For juror records, see sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2. 5.2 Confidential and Sealed Records Statutes define specific case types that are to be maintained as confidential records. Some types of records are confidential from the date the records are created and are never made available to the public. Other types of records may remain confidential for a period of time, and then become public. Under rule 2.550 of the California Rules of Court, a sealed record is a record that by court order is not open to inspection by the public. Under rule 2.551(f), “[s]ealed records must be securely filed and kept separate from the public file in the case. If the sealed records are in electronic form, appropriate access controls must be established to ensure that only authorized persons may access the sealed records.” Only a judicial officer has the authority to seal and unseal a record. For a more detailed discussion of confidential and sealed records, see section 10.3, “Confidential and Sealed Records.” 33 5.3 Subpoenaed Records and Documents Courts occasionally receive records produced pursuant to subpoenas to be opened at the time of a trial or another hearing. (Evid. Code, § 1560(b), (d).) These documents are typically not file stamped and may or may not be lodged in the court record. Under Evidence Code section 1560(d), if the parties do not agree otherwise, subpoenaed records delivered to the clerk of the court “shall remain sealed and shall be opened only at the time of trial ... or other hearing, upon the direction of the judge ... conducting the proceeding, in the presence of all parties who have appeared in person or by counsel at the trial ... or hearing. Records that are original documents and that are not introduced in evidence or required as part of the record shall be returned to the person or entity from whom received. Records that are copies may be destroyed.” 34 6. Storage, Maintenance, and Electronic Signing of Records 6.1 Standards for Paper and Electronic Records 6.1.1 Standards for Paper Records Storage Facilities There are no statutes or rules of court that provide guidance to trial courts related to records storage facilities. The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) has adopted the standards below for records storage facilities, however, which courts are encouraged to adopt as best practices to improve the likelihood that paper records will not deteriorate over time.3 1. Any records storage facility for public records should be constructed of noncombustible and fire-resistant materials. The facility should be of a nature that minimizes the potential for and the resultant effects of fire. 2. The facility should be a standalone structure. If the structure is shared with other tenants, fire walls of approved construction should separate the records storage facility from other areas in the building. 3. If the records storage facility is located in a structure with other nonrelated tenants, activities conducted in other parts of the building should not be of the nature that would create a hazard to the records stored there. 4. Access to the facility should be restricted to authorized personnel. Adequate security procedures and systems should be provided to prevent loss, theft, or destruction of public records and to ensure the safety and integrity of the public records stored there. 5. A records storage facility should maintain a fire prevention program based on good housekeeping practices. Smoking, use of open flame devices, or the presence of flammable materials should be prohibited in storage areas. 6. The facility should have appropriate fire detection and suppression systems with procedures in place to ensure their effectiveness. 7. A slightly positive air pressure balance should be maintained within the records storage area so as to ensure (1) consistency of temperature and relative humidity and (2) minimize infiltration of contaminants. 8. Air handling ducts should be equipped with fire detectors and applicable shutoff apparatus. 9. The facility should have a power supply sufficient to maintain environmental controls, security, lighting, and fire detection and suppression equipment. 10. No cellulose nitrate films should be stored in the facility. 3 The ANSI standards expressly did not address records used and maintained in file rooms in offices where they were created, records filed in central file areas, or records temporarily stored in staging areas. 35 11. All door openings of the records storage facility should be fitted with suitable and approved fire-resistant doors. 12. All electrical wiring within the facility, exclusive of low-power alarm circuits, should be encased in an approved conduit. 13. Portable fire extinguishers of a type appropriate for Class A fires should be readily accessible inside and immediately outside the record storage area. 14. All records storage containers within a facility should be kept at least six inches from piping or conduits. 15. Work, reference, and storage areas should be constructed so as to avoid prolonged exposure of archival records to direct or indirect sunlight, which contains ultraviolet rays that can damage archival material. Ultraviolet light filters should be placed on all fluorescent lights in areas where archival records are stored, displayed, processed, or researched. 16. Storage containers, folders, and other enclosures for archival material should be constructed of acid-free buffered, lignin-free paper or other material free of harmful off-gassing material. 6.1.2 Standards for Microfilm The purpose of reproducing court records is to generate a reliable and usable reproduction that is deemed and considered an original. It is necessary to determine if a reproduction is successful while the source documents are still available for re-imaging. Some level of inspection is necessary to determine if the various requirements have been met. A. Processing Microfilm The proper processing of film is crucial to permanent quality. The following tests are recommended in ANSI/AIIM4 MS23-1998, and may be performed by a microfilm processing lab or qualified court personnel to ensure quality film is produced: 1. Perform a Methylene Blue Test on the film to determine and measure residual thiosulfate left in the film. Excessive quantities of thiosulfate will over time have a bleaching action, causing silver images to turn yellowish brown. The test should be conducted within two weeks after processing. (ANSI/AIIM MS23-1998, § 9.3.2.1.1, pp. 71–72.) 2. Perform a density test. Density is measured on an instrument called a densitometer and is expressed as a numerical measure describing the lightness or darkness of a microfilm image. (ANSI/AIIM MS23-1998, §§ 6.2.2., 7.1.) A microimage will appear more readable when the contrast, or difference, between the background and the information (or clear) area is high, in terms of density. ( Id ., p. 42.) The density of 4 AIIM (Association for Information and Image Management) is the official Standards Development Organization for Content and Information Management standards authorized by ANSI. 36 microfilm is measured in two areas: Dmin is the light or clear, unexposed area of the film; Dmax is the dark or exposed background area. Camera films should have Dmin densities below 0.10, and Dmax densities near 1.20. ( Id ., § 9.5.1, p. 73.) 3. Perform a resolution test. Resolution, or resolving power, is the measure of a microfilm system’s ability to resolve and record fine detail. The resolution directly affects the legibility of documents being filmed. (ANSI/AIIM MS23-1998, § 6.1.16, p. 33.) 4. Perform a print test to inspect and verify that printed copies are legible. (ANSI/AIIM MS23-1998, § 10.) Please note that if any of the above mentioned criteria is not met, the microfilm reel should be rejected and the source documents should be refilmed. Logs should also be kept to record the above-mentioned criteria for each reel tested. (ANSI/AIIM MS-23 at pp. 96-99 [sample forms].) B. Industry Standards for Microfilm Records Storage Facilities Providing a suitable storage environment for microfilm is essential. If properly stored, microfilm can last from 100 (acetate based) to 500 (silver film) years. Industry standards5 for storing recommend: 1. Microfilm should be stored in a secured, sealed, airtight room with a constant cool environment with temperatures not exceeding 70 degrees. 2. Relative humidity should be maintained between 20 and 30 percent and should not fluctuate + 5 percent in a 24-hour period. 3. The storage room should include a properly designed and functioning HVAC system that controls the temperature and humidity and minimizes the infiltration of pollutants. 4. Microfilm enclosures (e.g., paper and plastic boxes) should be made of noncorroding materials that meet certain chemical and photographic criteria. 5. An ongoing inspection procedure should be established to determine if the microfilm is degrading in any way. 6.1.3 Standards for Electronic Records Historically, court records have been stored in paper form. However, in 2010, Government Code sections 68150 and 68151 were amended, authorizing courts to create and maintain court records electronically. An electronic record is information produced by, or with the aid of, a computer or other electronic device. An electronic record may be stored on a variety of 5 See, e.g., 36 C.F.R. §§ 1238.5, 1238.20 (incorporating by reference ISO 18911 and ANSI/PIMA [Photographic Imaging & Manufacturers Association, Inc.] IT9.2). 37 electronic media (e.g., a hard disk, a solid state drive, a USB or thumb drive, a CD, or a DVD). Electronic court records may include:  Documents (e.g., orders, judgments, motions, and declarations);  Electronically stored exhibits (e.g., photographs, video, and voice recordings);  Data submitted as part of other filed case records (e.g., fillable forms or electronic filings); and  Electronic recordings of oral proceedings. The fact that an electronic device is needed to create and maintain a record does not alter the fact that it is a court record, although the methods used to store and manage electronic records are, of course, different than those used for paper records. To assist courts in managing their electronic records, this section addresses the following points:  File formats;  Scanning and digitizing;  Public access and reproduction;  Confidential and sealed records;  Integrity and security of records;  Technology refresh;  Backup and storage; and  Retention and destruction. 6.1.3.1 Process Overview Courts may convert paper records to electronic records by using a document scanner to create digital images of paper records, reviewing the images on a computer, and storing them in a document repository. During the scanning process, basic information about individual records (associated case numbers, document types, and other case-related information) may be automatically captured or manually entered to create an index. The resulting electronic record is then reviewed for quality assurance and stored. Courts also create original electronic records and may receive records through electronic filing (or e-filing) systems. Having created or received a new electronic record, a court may add index information about it, such as record type or other case-related information. E-filing systems also ensure that submitted documents are associated with their corresponding case information, and track information such as submission time, and the name of the submitter. 38 Electronic court records are stored on court-managed computer systems, backup media, and redundant computer systems. A court case management system or standalone document management software controls access. 6.1.3.2 File Formats A file format is a particular way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. When trying to determine the most appropriate file format to use for long-term access and preservation, a trial court may want to consider whether file formats are:  Based on open standards and nonproprietary;  Widely used and accepted; and  Stable, well-supported, and well-documented. In choosing file formats, the trial courts should consider current and future compatibility within the trial courts and between the trial courts and their justice partners, as well as accessibility for the public. A. Common File Format Types Document files . Document files are most often created with word-processing programs, which can be saved in a variety of formats. Common file formats for document files include:  TXT – plain text files. File size is small, and the document is searchable but limited to plain text only. There is minimal ability to format document text, and images are not supported.  DOC – developed by Microsoft, widely used in Windows environment. The file size is often large, especially with graphics, and can possibly be used to transmit viruses. DOC files can be edited with Microsoft Word for Windows or MacOS and OpenOffice for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Solaris.  DOCX – Microsoft’s implementation of the XML-based format is not proprietary, so it can be created and used outside of Microsoft Office. The file size is often large, especially with graphics, and can possibly be used to transmit viruses.  CSV (Comma-Separated Values) – a common data-exchange format. Each line of the file is a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields separated by commas or other delimiters (e.g., semicolons, spaces, or tabs).  PDF (Portable Document Format) – developed by Adobe Systems. This format is widely used since it can combine many multimedia elements such as sound, graphics, images, and text in a format that can be read on many platforms, including mobile devices. It is also small in size, and the reader application is free and available on most operating systems. PDF files can only be created and edited with PDF-creation software. 39  PDF/A – a version of PDF meeting specialized standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for long-term archiving of electronic documents. Files are 100 percent self-contained. All information required to display the document is encapsulated in the file. (ISO 19005-1:2005, https://www.iso.org/standard/38920.html .) In selecting the appropriate file format for a specific document, courts may wish to consider the requirements or limitations of the court’s document viewing software, its case management system, and any other bench tools utilized. Graphics files . Graphics files store an image (e.g., a photograph or drawing). Common file formats for graphic files include:  JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) – commonly used for graphics on webpages and photos taken with a digital camera. The JPEG format utilizes a method known as lossy compression to produce smaller sizes than other formats, effecting a tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG files can be viewed with most web browsers.  TIFF (Tag Image File Format) – often used for storing high-quality images. Although often produced in an uncompressed format, TIFF files can also utilize lossless compression, allowing reduced file sizes without any loss of image quality. Viewing TIFF images typically requires a picture or fax viewer (often included with computer operating systems). B. File Format Characteristics When choosing a specific file format for electronic records, courts should consider the following characteristics to ensure they meet operational and legal requirements: 1. File size – file size will vary depending upon the format selected. File size is also related to the portability and searchability of a record. A file encoded to be portable and easily viewed on any device will be larger than one encoded in a more proprietary format. Encoding a file to enable text searching within the record may increase the record size by 5 to 10 percent. 2. Accessibility – courts should facilitate public and judicial partner access to electronic records by selecting file formats that provide the broadest level of accessibility. A court should not require the use of a particular software or tool but rather should provide electronic records in a format that can be viewed by a large number of software platforms and devices. 3. Longevity – court records have specific retention periods. When selecting a file format, a court needs to determine how long the record will be retained. In general, the longer a file must be kept, the more portable it should be. 40 4. Searchability – some file formats preserve records as an image and therefore result in a file with contents that cannot be searched. 5. Record formatting – formatting and content of the original record must be preserved. Nontext images like signatures, charts, or diagrams must be supported by the selected file format. The chart below summarizes the characteristics: Format File Size Accessibility Longevity Searchable Document Formatting TXT Small Excellent Excellent Yes Poor DOCX Medium Fair Fair Yes Excellent CSV Medium Fair Fair Yes Excellent PDF Small Good Very Good Yes Excellent PDF/A Medium Good Excellent Yes Excellent JPEG Large Very Good Very Good No Good TIFF Very Large Very Good Very Good No Excellent C. Selecting a Format Recommended: 1. PDF/A is the recommended file format for long-term/permanent preservation of electronic records. With excellent longevity, searchability, and good accessibility, PDF/A is an excellent choice for courts. Although PDF/A files are slightly larger than PDF files and therefore require more storage space, this issue will become less important over time as the unit cost of storage continues to drop. PDF/A files are approximately 5 percent to 20 percent larger than a PDF file but approximately the same size as a Microsoft Word document. 2. PDF is the recommended file format for short-term preservation of electronic records. Although PDF may not be as accessible as PDF/A in the long term, PDF files are smaller in size and retain all the other benefits of PDF/A. Alternatives: 1. Courts may wish to consider TIFF as an alternative format for long-term preservation of electronic records because it is highly accessible and has very good longevity. However, the inability to perform searches within a TIFF file and its larger file size may make this format unsuitable for some environments. 41 Not Recommended: 1. DOC is a proprietary format and is not recommended. It is developed and managed by a specific vendor for use with specific software programs and is not intended for long-term record preservation. 2. TXT files are unable to capture images and rich document formatting and are not a recommended file format for electronic records. 3. JPEG documents can be large, are unsearchable, and are subject to loss of quality when the original document is converted to electronic format. 6.1.3.3 Scanning and Digitizing Paper documents may be scanned to create digital images that are stored as electronic records. Accessibility, full text search opportunities, and physical space savings are several reasons that a court may decide to transform its paper documents, making them available electronically. A. Best Practices The following best practices will ensure that documents that are scanned and digitally imaged will meet practical requirements for image quality, retention, and security:  Before disposing of the original paper documents after they are scanned, courts should ensure that there are at least two copies of the record stored in electronic format on a trusted system (e.g., production and storage backup or local and disaster recovery copies).  To ensure image quality, courts should use a minimum scanning resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi) for all future projects when electronically imaging documents for archival purposes. This will ensure the scanned documents will comply with the California Rules of Court, AIIM guidelines, and National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards.  Care and consideration should be given with regard to “hidden” data and metadata when exporting electronic files for use outside of the court. This data may contain identifiers or information that would not be appropriate for disclosure (e.g., working notes from the judicial officer hearing a case, or personal identifiers such as birth dates).  If electronic records are stored with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) metadata contained in the file (e.g., to facilitate text searches), the metadata should be contained “behind” the image of the document. The original image of the document should be preserved and should not be replaced with information resulting from OCR.  There may be variations in the level of quality of existing digital images that were created using older technologies (e.g., microfilmed documents at 200 dpi). Courts may wish to certify these records by stamping them “Correct Copy of the Original” or “Best Available Image” when requested to produce a copy from electronic storage. 42 B. Color Palettes A color palette describes the type and number of colors used when converting a scanned document or image to electronic format. There are three primary color palettes that can be used when scanning documents: 1. Black and White – everything contained in the original document is converted to one of these two colors. 2. Grayscale – document and image contents are converted to black, white, or shades of gray. Typically up to 65,536 levels of gray are available. 3. Color – all colors of the original document or image are retained in the electronic version. When choosing a specific color palette for electronic records, courts should consider the following characteristics: 1. File size – file size will vary depending upon the color palette selected. Documents scanned as grayscale and color are about two to three times larger than those scanned as black and white. 2. Clarity – while all color palettes will represent black and white text-only documents well, documents that contain handwriting, images, or carbon copies will vary in clarity depending upon the color palette used. 3. Accuracy – when an exact copy of an image is required, the color palette that best represents the original should be used. The chart below summarizes these characteristics: Palette File Size Clarity Accuracy Best for Black and White Small Fair Fair  Black and white text-only documents  Black and white text-only documents with simple tables Grayscale Large Good Good  Documents that contain a wet signature or fingerprint  Carbon copy documents  Documents printed on colored paper Color Large Good Excellent  Images and content that contain color 43 Recommended: For simple documents consisting of plain text on a white background, a black and white palette is recommended. For all other documents, a grayscale color palette is recommended. Although resulting file sizes may be two to three times larger than for black and white scanning, the size differences may not be significant, particularly when balanced against the improvements in image quality, readability, and searching capacity that grayscale offers. Particularly, when it is important to capture a wet signature, fingerprint, graphics, or other nontext content, grayscale may be the best option. Not Recommended:  Color images: Color images may be large and usually are unnecessary when imaging the majority of court documents. Although the resulting size of a document captured as color is about the same as a document captured as grayscale, printing an electronic color document requires a color printer for best results. The exception would be where an exact copy of an image is required and accuracy dictates use of a color palette.  Compressed formats : Smaller file sizes can be achieved through the use of compression. Caution must be exercised, however, because the quality and readability of the scan may be significantly compromised. To ensure maximum clarity and accuracy, the best practice is to use an uncompressed format or a format that employs lossless compression. If compression is used, care must be taken to ensure there are no visible artifacts or text distortion. C. Quality Assurance In order to realize all the anticipated benefits of scanning and imaging records, it is imperative to ensure the quality of the imaged records. This is a two-step process: 1. Initial data validations should be performed at multiple points during the document capture process (i.e., at indexing time). 2. Secondary inspections should be performed after document capture. At multiple points during the initial scanning and imaging (or capture) process—and again, after the process is completed—the following attributes must be inspected:  Image quality;  Index accuracy; and  Record completeness. During the Initial Capture Process Image Quality The scanned image must be legible to the human eye (i.e., readable). Defects—such as speckling, skewing, streaking, poor contrast, folded pages, and tears—are acceptable if the document is legible. A fold or crease that does not block text is acceptable. If any text is 44 illegible, however, the scanned record is not acceptable. There is software available to correct image quality problems during document capture. For best results, every page of a scanned document should be reviewed. Barring that level of review, at least the first, middle, and last pages should be reviewed. This lesser level of review works on the principle that many image quality problems are related to the scanning process and cause the same defect on every page. Note that this may not catch page-level defects caused by folded corners, colored paper, or unclear original copies of triplicate images (i.e., No Carbon Required (NCR) paper). To avoid unnecessary rescanning, extremely poor-quality originals that cannot be corrected or enhanced could be stamped “Best Available Image.” Index Accuracy While some index fields are critical for locating documents, other fields provide additional information but are not necessarily critical. There are multiple methods for ensuring the accuracy of critical index values. 1. Character-Level Validations – Individual characters can be validated through the use of character filters, which prevent the entry of invalid characters. For example, a phone number field would not allow entry of alphabetic characters. This type of validation should be real time without slowing the user down. Invalid keystrokes should be blocked as they are typed rather than waiting to validate the data when saving the document or after moving to the next field to be entered. 2. Field-Level Validation – Field-level edits can help catch errors as soon as the field is completed. Examples include minimum and maximum values, minimum and maximum number of characters, and date range checks. Values may be selected from drop-down lists when applicable or compared against lists of valid values prior to saving the data. Check digits or other types of calculation validations are useful when applicable. 3. Record-Level Validation – Some data cannot be validated until all fields have been entered and the user is ready to save the data. For example, if names are optional but a first name is entered, the last name must also be entered. Any messages displayed should be as clear as possible to make it easy for the indexer to make corrections. Results of record-level validation must be displayed as quickly as possible to avoid negatively impacting throughput. 4. Double Key Entry – For critical index data, the most effective way to ensure accuracy of key-entered data is to key it twice and programmatically compare the results. If the values do not match, they must be reentered. Blind double-key entry requires the key entry to be performed by two different people. This increases the likelihood of accuracy because it is less likely two different people will make the same typographical errors. 45 5. External Validation – If authoritative data is stored in an external system such as a case management system, that system can be queried to validate or populate index data. Integration effort and speed of access to data residing in the external system must be considered to ensure that overall processing time is acceptable. Some courts may generate index information by creating barcode cover sheets from the case management system. In this situation, any of the five previous approaches can be used as appropriate. However, validation that the document is associated with the correct case will vary depending upon the specific imaging, quality assurance, and case management technologies used. Record Completeness The most effective way to ensure a record is complete is to count pages before scanning and then to have the software compare the human count to the machine count. There are two ways to count the pages:  Pre-blank page removal; and  Post-blank page removal. The pre-blank page removal count is the count of physical pages in the batch, including document separator sheets. It is independent of whether the pages are duplex or simplex. The post-blank page removal count is the count of actual images after programmatically removing blank pages and separator sheets. This count is much more cumbersome to obtain since the user must examine the front and back of every page and track. Whichever counting method is applied, there are three possible outcomes to the comparison: 1. The counts match; 2. The machine count is higher; or 3. The machine count is lower. If the counts match, the batch can be accepted with a high degree of certainty that the records are complete. If the machine count is higher, it is likely that the human undercounted because it is unlikely that a page was captured twice. To increase certainty, the batch could be rescanned to see if the machine count remains the same. If the machine count is lower, it is possible that the scanner double-fed two or more pages or that the human count was too high. In this case the batch should be recounted and rescanned. Note that the pre-blank page removal counts could match while the software could remove a page that is not technically blank, causing the document to be incomplete. In order to 46 maximize the level of certainty that all records are complete, both counts should be performed and compared. After The Capture Process Even if all the above steps are taken to ensure record quality during the initial capture process, random records should be examined after the capture process is completed. The same attributes—image quality, index accuracy, and record completeness—should be examined again. Defects should be corrected to the extent possible. If the original source records have been destroyed, then poor images cannot be rescanned. They can, however, be modified electronically to remove blank pages, or combined or split to accommodate for missing document separator sheets. Incorrect index data should be corrected. The sampling plan is based on the desired Acceptance Quality Limit (AQL). There are a number of publications detailing acceptable sampling procedures, including American National Standards Institute/American Society of Quality (ANSI/ASQ) standard Z1.4. 6.1.3.4 Public Access and Reproduction Like other court records, a court’s electronic records must be accessible to the public and must be reproduceable with at least the same amount of convenience as paper records previously provided. (Gov. Code, § 68150(c).) This means the records must be indexed. (Gov. Code, § 68150(e).) The public must be able to retrieve and view a court’s electronic records. Computer or web-based technology will be required to allow the public to do so. Courts will also need to provide a means for members of the public to copy or otherwise reproduce such records. A. Best Practices  Implement systems and procedures to ensure that the court’s electronic records are easily accessible by the public both onsite (within court facilities) and remotely (offsite or away from court facilities) using computer or web-based technology, complying with the rules of court regarding public access. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.500 et seq.)  Ensure that the court’s electronic records are reproducible by the public within court facilities by providing the public with access to computer printers or printing services.  Implement court case management systems and web-based services that together provide prompt public access to newly received or updated electronic records. B. Examples  Implement self-service kiosks in court lobbies or other publicly accessible areas, equipped with hardened (secure) personal computers and printers, allowing the public to access and reproduce electronic court records. 47  Implement news media kiosks, webpages, or drop boxes to enable prompt media access to newly filed or recently updated electronic court records. 6.1.3.5 Confidential and Sealed Records Electronic court records are the same as other court records. Statutory and rule provisions addressing confidentiality and sealing of court records apply equally to paper records and to electronic records. (See section 10.3 (“Confidential and Sealed Records”), and Appendix 1 (“Court Records Designated Confidential By Statute Or Rule”).) The form of the records, however, may change the manner of controlling access to those records. While the confidentiality of paper records may be protected by restricting physical access, for example, the confidentiality of records in the form of electronic documents or data must be protected using technological means. A. Best Practices  Control and monitor physical access to buildings, rooms, and equipment where electronic court records are stored.  Establish logical access controls, limiting connections to computer networks and systems, where electronic court records are stored.  Implement court case management, network, and web-based systems that together provide reliable measures for ensuring confidentiality and sealing of selected information stored in electronic court records.  Implement technology systems that allow incremental, controlled access to individual pieces of information contained in electronic court records to protect any confidential or sealed pieces of information.  Ensure that any technological means used to protect confidentiality, or to redact or seal electronic court records, function equally and consistently both for onsite access (within court facilities), and for remote access (offsite or away from court facilities using web-based technology).  Establish procedures for addressing circumstances in which the status of specific court records changes, either from public to confidential or sealed, or the reverse. B. Examples  Ensure that the physical access to office areas housing court technology systems is restricted and controlled by means such as: o Access badges; o Key locks; o Cipher locks; o Access logs; and o Security cameras. 48  Ensure that all court computers, servers, and network equipment are secured with password protection, and screen or console “locks” when not in use.  Use PKI (public key infrastructure) encryption technologies for external transmission of sensitive electronic court records to preserve confidentiality.  Ensure that any computer equipment located in publicly accessible areas of the court (such as self-help kiosks) is “hardened” (secured) via enhanced security measures such as: o Kiosk software, which tightly restricts what can and cannot be done on a computer; o Restrictive network or centralized management and operating systems configuration (for example, Windows Group Policy) security settings; and o Physically or logically separating such equipment from all other court systems.  Implement network security systems to protect against unauthorized access (e.g., by hackers) at publicly accessible self-help locations, and through external connections such as the public internet. 6.1.3.6 Integrity and Security of Records Electronic court records must be created and maintained in a manner that ensures accuracy and preserves the integrity of the records throughout their maintenance. (Gov. Code, § 68150(c).) These records must be stored in a manner and place that reasonably ensures their preservation against loss, theft, defacement, or destruction for the prescribed retention period. (Gov. Code, § 68150(h).) A. Best Practices  Protect the integrity of electronic court records, protect the systems on which the records are kept, and prevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of the records, by limiting access to them.  Provide security and certainty by using identity verification or digital signature (encryption) technologies to confirm the origin, history, and integrity of electronic court records.  Develop and implement audit trails to detect and record attempts to access, delete, or destroy an electronic court record, verify compliance with prescribed security procedures, and determine whether unauthorized acts have occurred or were attempted. B. Examples  Implement network and application-level security using role-based user profiles, unique individual sign-ons, and stringent password protection, including multifactor authentication. 49  Implement network security systems such as firewalls, proxy gateways, content filters, and virus protection suites, along with network activity monitoring and logging.  Use PKI encryption utilities to protect confidential electronic court records during external transmission.  Use identity management systems for identifying, authenticating, and authorizing access privileges for selected individuals, groups, or entities (such as other California courts, justice partners, and attorney services or legal support firms). 6.1.3.7 Technology Refresh Procedures for technology monitoring and refresh should ensure that existing electronic records are retrievable and viewable in the future. This section is divided into three parts. The first part focuses on the suggested refresh cycle and update procedures for scanning and storage hardware. The second part focuses on update procedures for scanning software. The third part identifies industry standards organizations that should be monitored. A. Scanning and Storage Hardware Most document imaging solutions have three main hardware components: the scanner; the scanning workstation; and the document repository. Each plays a vital role in the overall process and performance of the scanning solution. Most courts have hardware refresh cycles that they follow. These may be sufficient. The industry standard for replacement of scanning and imaging hardware is between five and seven years. (AIIM.org, 2011.) If a court’s hardware replacement cycle policy meets these guidelines, then the document imaging solution can simply be included in the court’s existing processes. If the court’s policy does not meet these guidelines, then the court may need to establish a different process for specifically refreshing the hardware components of the document imaging solution. Since the document imaging solution typically resides on one or more personal computers or servers, the court should follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for driver updates and patches. It is not recommended that new drivers or patches be applied as soon as they are released, unless there is a specific problem or issue that the driver or patch is expected to solve. All patches and drivers should be tested in a separate environment before being applied to the production environment if possible. B. Scanning Software The document imaging solution may be all inclusive or it may rely on other software, such as a relational database management system. Regardless of the requirements of each court’s 50 individual document imaging solution, there are some best practices and general guidelines that should be followed. The underlying operating system should always be patched and protected from viruses and malware. This can be accomplished by applying system updates and patches once they are tested and determined to be stable. Each court may have a policy or procedure on how and when system patches are applied, and these may meet or exceed industry guidelines. Courts should follow a process that best protects the operating system, meets the court’s specific business requirements, and complies with the judicial branch information security framework. The specific document imaging software (e.g., scanning software, document management software) will also have periodic patches and updates. It is recommended that these be installed based on the software manufacturer’s recommendations only after being applied to a test or staging environment first to ensure that existing functionality performs as expected and the impact of the patch and update is fully understood. C. Industry Standards Organizations There are two primary organizations that help shape the document management industry: the Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM); and Association of Records Managers and Administrators (ARMA). Both associations offer insight and guidance for document management. The recommendations and publications from these two organizations should be monitored and courts should consider new technologies or guidelines at least once a year. 6.1.3.8 Data Backup and Storage The electronic copy of a court record may be the only copy that exists. Therefore, preservation of that electronic information is critical. Storage of the primary copy of an electronic record should be reliable. Duplicate copies should be stored in different locations in case of a disaster. In addition to backup and storage, courts should ensure that all electronically stored data can be retrieved today and in the future. A. Storage Media and Locations Courts typically store their electronic records on magnetic disk, optical disc, or magnetic tape. Additionally, some courts may use solid-state storage or cloud storage. Each type of media varies in the speed of access, capacity, and durability. Courts should not rely on a single type of storage media but instead use a combination of media focused on a specific purpose. The following chart provides some general characteristics and suggested usage: 51 Media Type Speed Capacity Durability Usage Magnetic Disk (e.g., hard disk drives) Very Fast Medium Low Primary storage and access to frequently used data. Solid-State Drive Extremely Fast Medium Low Used in place of magnetic disks when high performance or high data transfer rates are required. Flash Media (e.g., USB or thumb drives) Fast Low Low Used when portability between systems is needed. This format has the highest risk of data loss or compromise. Optical Disc (e.g., CD, DVD, Blu-ray drives) Fast Low High Secondary storage and access to occasionally used data. Magnetic Tape Slow High Medium Long-term backup. Only used for data recovery purposes. There is a potential challenge for court records in the form of data. The challenge arises because digital court records can be completely self-contained as a single file or record in a database, or can exist as multiple files created and stored in different formats that the case management system combines and presents as a single record. For example, a case management system might store information about a case in text format within a SQL (Structured Query Language) database, but might store document images of filings associated with the case in a separate document management system. In such cases, it is crucial to ensure that all necessary information related to a case can be “bundled” together for archiving or transmitting, and then restored or reassembled when needed. Additionally, it is worth noting that some courts may store electronic records (1) at a location controlled by a vendor (for example, a “vendor hosted” case management Software as a Service (SaaS) solution); or (2) over a secure internet connection using a cloud computing service. 52 When using a storage option that places electronic court records outside the direct physical control of the court, a court should take care to ensure that key staff have a complete understanding of the technology platform and process being used to save and store the records. Specific and clear contractual obligations also must be established between the court and the vendor or service provider protecting the continued security, confidentiality, and accessibility of the court records over time. B. Backup and Redundancy Data backup provides a long-term storage solution for data recovery in the case of a major disaster or catastrophe. Backup copies of all electronic court records can be made on various storage media based on an individual court’s business requirements and resources. Copies should be distributed and stored in different locations to protect them against potential disasters such as fire or flood. A data backup is usually performed daily. Recovery from a data backup will likely result in some data loss between the time the backup was made and the time of disaster. Data redundancy provides a short-term storage solution for data recovery in the case of an immediate system failure or power outage. Data redundancy requires that all electronic information is immediately stored twice—typically on magnetic media located in different physical locations. Since all data is immediately copied to a separate system, there is typically no data loss when the primary system fails. However, this solution is costly since it requires a full duplicate of the production system and the data must be synchronized between the two systems to ensure that changes made to the primary system are also made to the duplicate system. C. Long-term Accessibility To ensure long-term accessibility of electronic court data, courts should review their data storage technology periodically, at least every three to five years, to ensure that stored data can be retrieved. For example, ensure that technology exists to read backup tapes that have been placed into long-term storage and that optical discs that have been archived can be read by current optical readers. If possible, courts should occasionally also take a random sample of backups that have been made and actually try to access the data using current technology to ensure that the backup is still accessible and contains valid information. Courts should anticipate that storage and retrieval technology will continue to evolve and that new formats and standards will be created. Consequently, all electronic records may at some point need to be migrated from existing technology platforms to new technology platforms. 53 When selecting a data backup and storage solution, both overall cost and technology longevity must be considered and balanced. As technology ages, it becomes more difficult to retrieve data from storage devices as storage formats and connectivity standards evolve. For example, site data replication to a remote storage area network is likely to be more easily and reliably accessed in the long-term but the initial implementation costs and ongoing network costs must also be considered. Magnetic tape on the other hand typically has a lower initial cost but tape storage formats and mechanisms tend to change faster. Selecting a Solution Recommended: 1. Electronic records should be copied to magnetic tape or other medium daily for data backup and stored in an offsite storage location. 2. Physical records should not be destroyed until a backup of the electronic copy of the records is made and confirmed to be retrievable. Alternatives: 1. Optical storage can be used as secondary storage for infrequently accessed information. 2. Both onsite and offsite data redundancy and replication can be implemented if resources are available to add an extra level of data protection in case of a short-term service disruption. Not Recommended: 1. Proprietary solutions that are only supported by a single vendor may jeopardize the ability to retrieve the electronic records in the future. 6.1.3.9 Retention and Destruction Electronic records should be retained per Government Code section 68152 and destroyed per Government Code section 68153. For more information on records retention and destruction, see section 11, “Retention, Preservation, and Destruction of Court Records.” Individual court records retention procedures should include the retention and destruction of electronic case management records, electronic documents, and physical case files. The electronic repository of court records should be managed with the same focus as the physical records retention requirements have been managed. For example, if records are eligible for destruction, but an index is required, the case index would be preserved and the electronic case file would be deleted, just as the physical paper would be destroyed. (See Gov. Code, § 68150(e) [“Court records shall be indexed for convenient access”]; id ., § 69842 [separate case indexes shall be maintained for civil and criminal cases, listing party names and case numbers].) When destroying records, a court must note the date of destruction either in the case index or on a separate destruction index. ( Id ., § 68153(b).) 54 Each individual court should determine how long they wish to retain the original physical document after it has been converted to electronic format. Minimally, a court should not destroy the original physical document until the electronic copy of the document has been verified as a true image, copied to a backup, and that the backup has been validated. Courts can save physical space, electronic storage, and management effort by destroying documents and electronic records as soon as feasibly possible. 6.1.3.10 References United States National Archives and Records Administration transfer requirements regarding PDF documents containing OCR, www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/pdf-records.html California Secretary of State, Regulations, Trustworthy Electronic Document or Record Preservation (2 Cal.

Purpose This section provides standards and guidelines for the creation of electronic signatures by judicial officers and the superior courts. These standards and guidelines implement Government Code section 68150(g), which provides that any notice, order, judgment, decree, decision, ruling, opinion, memorandum, warrant, certificate of service, writ, subpoena, or other legal process, or similar document issued by a superior court or a judicial officer of a superior court may be signed, subscribed, or verified using computer or other technology in accordance with procedures, standards, and guidelines established by the Judicial Council. The following principles guided the drafters in preparing these standards and guidelines:  Electronic signature standards should provide appropriate requirements and should generally not be more restrictive than standards for traditional “wet” signatures.  Electronic signature standards should consider how the signature is being applied when setting the level of authentication required.  Electronic signature standards should allow for flexibility in the method of applying and the appearance of the signature.  Electronic signature standards, wherever possible, should avoid requiring specific proprietary tools. Instead the standards should present attributes of acceptable authentication tools and encourage leveraging security within other business-critical systems. B. Definitions As used in these standards and guidelines, the following definitions apply:  Electronic means relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities.  Electronic court record means a court record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means.  Electronic signature means an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic court record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the electronic court record. (Code Civ. Proc., § 17(b)(3).) 56  Person includes judicial officers, court clerks, deputy court clerks, and others authorized to sign documents issued by a judicial officer or a court.  Record means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.  Security procedure means a procedure employed for the purpose of verifying that an electronic signature, record, or performance is that of a specific person or for detecting changes or errors in the information in an electronic record. The term includes a procedure that requires the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, or callback or other acknowledgment procedures. C. Format of Signatures Unless otherwise prescribed in a statute or rule, an electronic signature may be in the form of:  A digitized image of the person’s signature;  An “/s/” followed by the person’s name; or  Any other electronically created method of indicating with clarity the name of the person whose signature is being affixed to the document. All such signatures, to be legally effective, must satisfy the requirements stated in this section. D. Electronic Signatures Must Be Executed or Adopted With an Intent to Sign, Attributable to an Authorized Person, and Capable of Verification The following guidelines apply to electronic signatures executed or adopted by a judicial officer or the court:  When a person is presented with the opportunity to sign a document electronically, it must be clear to the person that he or she is being asked to sign the document electronically. This demonstrates that the person in fact intended to sign the document. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 17(b)(3) [electronic signatures must be “executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign”].)  When a document is to be signed electronically, it must be presented only to an authorized person or to someone authorized to execute the signature on the person’s behalf.  An electronic signature is attributed to a person if it was the act of that person (or the act of someone authorized to execute or adopt the signature on that person’s behalf), which may be shown in any manner, including by showing the efficacy of any security procedure applied when the signature was executed or adopted.  The identity of the person who executed or adopted the electronic signature must be capable of verification. If a document is signed electronically, the court should retain any data relevant to verifying the signature, such as the identity of the person who 57 executed or adopted the signature and the date and time that the signature was executed or adopted. Courts should consider designing business practices and technology systems—such as workflows, pop-up screens, and access and security procedures—to facilitate compliance with these guidelines. Courts may want to consider utilizing different electronic signatures depending on whether the electronic signature is executed and adopted by a person or by someone authorized to execute and adopt the signature on that person’s behalf. For example, if a clerk is authorized to sign on behalf of a judge, the clerk’s initials could be placed after the judge’s signature. Utilizing different signatures depending on the identity of the signer would make it easier to distinguish who actually executed or adopted the signature from the face of the document. Regardless, the court would still retain any data relevant to identifying the person who executed or adopted the signature for verification purposes. In deciding what types of verification data should be retained, courts may want to consider saving (1) the owner/user ID and timestamp (date and time) generated when a document is prepared, changed, or acted upon; and (2) the owner/user ID and timestamp (date and time) when the signer logs into an application, if the electronic signature is executed using an application. E. Signatures Under Penalty of Perjury If a law requires that a statement be signed under penalty of perjury, the requirement is satisfied with respect to an electronic signature if an electronic record includes:  The electronic signature;  All of the information as to which the declaration pertains; and  A declaration under penalty of perjury by the person who submits the electronic signature that the information is true and correct. F. Legal Effect Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, all notices, orders, judgments, decrees, decisions, rulings, opinions, memoranda, warrants, certificates of service, writs, subpoenas, or other legal process, or similar documents that are signed, subscribed, or verified by computer or other technological means shall have the same validity, and the same legal force and effect, as paper documents signed, subscribed, or verified by a court official or judicial officer. (Gov. Code, § 68150(g); see Code Civ. Proc., § 34 [“An electronic signature ... by a court or judicial officer shall be as effective as an original signature”].) 58 A signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form. The legal effect of an electronic signature is determined from the context and circumstances surrounding its creation, execution, or adoption, and otherwise as provided by law. G. Acceptable Security Procedures for Verification of Identity When Applying Electronic Signature The acceptable procedures for verifying the identity of persons executing electronic signatures are varied and are subject to change as the technology in this area is developing quickly. Certain guidelines can be applied at this time to determine whether electronic signatures are verifiable. First, all systems used in the capture, application, and storage of electronic media, including any electronic signatures or electronic documents, should align, to the extent possible, with the data and information security guidelines recommended in How to Use the Information Systems Controls Framework. This ensures that access to any electronic signature, any electronically signed document, and the tools and mechanisms for applying an electronic signature is limited to authorized individuals and that original files and documents have not been altered or modified since they were created. Second, currently acceptable procedures for verification of electronic signatures include the following: 1. Real-time digitized electronic signatures A digitized signature is a graphical image of a handwritten signature. The signature is captured by means of a digital pen, pad, or other device that converts the physical act of signing into a digital representation of the signature and applies that digital representation to the document, transaction, or database entry. User authentication before the application of the digitized signature should be similar to authentication methods used when a physical handwritten signature is applied to a hard copy or traditional paper document. 2. System-applied electronic signatures A system-applied electronic signature is an electronic signature that is applied to a document, transaction, or database using a computer, software, or application following affirmative action by the individual or by a person authorized to act on the individual’s behalf. An example of an affirmative action could include, for example, a requirement that a signer click on an “OK” box. User authentication permitting a system-applied electronic signature may be obtained through one of the following methods: 59  Password or PIN — User identity is verified by entering a password or PIN either to gain access to the computer application, database, or network, or to apply a signature, or both.  Symmetric Cryptography —User identity is verified using a cryptographic key known to the system and to the individual who is signing the document. This is often done by entering a single-use password that is randomly generated.  Asymmetric Cryptography (Digital Certificates) —User identity is verified using both private and public keys. This is the most secure method of verifying a user’s identity and should be considered for signatures made under penalty of perjury.  Biometrics —User identity is verified using biometrics, including but not limited to voice, fingerprint, or retina. The method selected should take into consideration business requirements, cost, and the relative risks and consequences of a breach. Courts should document and adopt security procedures for authentication before implementing a system-applied electronic signature. H. Judicial Signatures on Scanned Documents Government Code section 68150(a) authorizes the preservation and maintenance of trial court records in electronic form. Under this provision, trial courts may convert their paper records to electronic form by scanning them to create digital images. The act of scanning an original signature results in a digitized signature. The digitized signature of a court or judicial officer created by scanning shall have the same validity, and the same legal force and effect, as the original signature. (Code Civ. Proc., § 34.) I. Examples of Court-Created Documents That May Be Electronically Signed by a Judicial Officer or Clerk The following is a list of various court-created documents that may be signed electronically by a judge or clerk under Government Code section 68150(g). This list is provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to suggest that a signature is required on these documents, unless a signature is otherwise mandated by statute or rule. 60  Judgments  Deferred entry of judgment  Orders after hearings  Minute orders  Exemplifications of records  Probable cause determinations  Arrest warrants  Search warrants  Bench warrants  Protective orders  Letters for probate  Writs of attachment  Writs of possession  Writs of execution  Lis pendens  Abstracts of judgment  Summonses  Notices  Fee waivers granted by statute  Certificates of mailing  Clerk’s declarations  Entry of judgment  Notices of intent to dispose of exhibits  Certifications of records  Clerk’s certificates of service  Felony abstracts of judgment  Notices of cost of electronic recording 6.2.2 Electronic Signatures on Documents Submitted to the Courts A. Purpose The purpose of this section is to provide guidance on the signatures that appear on documents that are electronically submitted to courts. There is no single statutory authorization for the use of electronic signatures in this context, similar to that which exists for the signatures of judicial officers and court clerks under Government Code section 68150(g) and Code of Civil Procedure section 34. There are, however, various statutes and rules on signatures on electronically submitted documents that apply to particular types of proceedings. B. Signatures on Documents Filed Electronically in Civil Cases The statutes and rules on e-filing in civil cases include specific provisions on signatures. Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b)(2) provides: (A) When a document to be filed requires the signature of any person, not under penalty of perjury, the document shall be deemed to have been signed by the person who filed the document electronically. (B) When a document to be filed requires the signature, under penalty of perjury, of any person, the document shall be deemed to have been signed by that person if filed electronically and if either of the following conditions is satisfied: (i) The person has signed a printed form of the document before, or on the same day as, the date of filing. The attorney or other person filing the document represents, by the act of filing, that the declarant has complied with this section. The attorney or other person filing the document shall 61 maintain the printed form of the document bearing the original signature until final disposition of the case, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 68151 of the Government Code, and make it available for review and copying upon the request of the court or any party to the action or proceeding in which it is filed. (ii) The person has signed the document using a computer or other technology pursuant to the procedure set forth in a rule of court adopted by the Judicial Council by January 1, 2019. Similarly, the California Rules of Court specifically address the requirement for signatures on documents that are filed electronically with the court. As relevant here, rule 2.257 provides: (b) Documents signed under penalty of perjury When a document to be filed electronically provides for a signature under penalty of perjury of any person, the document is deemed to have been signed by that person if filed electronically provided that either of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) The declarant has signed the document using an electronic signature[6] and declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of California that the information submitted is true and correct. If the declarant is not the electronic filer, the electronic signature must be unique to the declarant, capable of verification, under the sole control of the declarant, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is invalidated; or (2) The declarant, before filing, has physically signed a printed form of the document. By electronically filing the document, the electronic filer certifies that the original, signed document is available for inspection and copying at the request of the court or any other party. In the event this second method of submitting documents electronically under penalty of perjury is used, the following conditions apply: (A) At any time after the electronic version of the document is filed, any party may serve a demand for production of the original signed document. The demand must be served on all other parties but need not be filed with the court. 6 Under rule 2.257(a), “[a]n electronic signature is an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign a document or record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means.” 62 (B) Within five days of service of the demand under (A), the party or other person on whom the demand is made must make the original signed document available for inspection and copying by all other parties. (C) At any time after the electronic version of the document is filed, the court may order the filing party or other person to produce the original signed document in court for inspection and copying by the court. The order must specify the date, time, and place for the production and must be served on all parties. (D) Notwithstanding (A)–(C), local child support agencies may maintain original, signed pleadings by way of an electronic copy in the statewide automated child support system and must maintain them only for the period of time stated in Government Code section 68152(a). If the local child support agency maintains an electronic copy of the original, signed pleading in the statewide automated child support system, it may destroy the paper original. (c) Documents not signed under penalty of perjury (1) If a document does not require a signature under penalty of perjury, the document is deemed signed by the party if the document is filed electronically. (2) When a document to be filed electronically, such as a stipulation, requires the signatures of opposing parties or persons other than the filer not under penalty of perjury, the following procedures apply: (A) The opposing party or other person has signed a printed form of the document before, or on the same day as, the date of the filing. The electronic filer must maintain the original, signed document and must make it available for inspection and copying as provided in (b)(2) of this rule and Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6. The court and any other party may demand production of the original signed document in the manner provided in (b)(2)(A)–(C). By electronically filing the document, the electronic filer indicates that all parties have signed the document and that the filer has the signed original in his or her possession. (B) The opposing party or other person has signed the document using an electronic signature and that electronic signature is unique to the person using it, capable of verification, under the sole control of the person using 63 it, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is invalidated. (d) Digital signature A party or other person is not required to use a digital signature on an electronically filed document. (e) Judicial signatures If a document requires a signature by a court or a judicial officer, the document may be electronically signed in any manner permitted by law. C. Signatures on Documents in Criminal and Traffic Cases In criminal and traffic proceedings, the Legislature has authorized the use of electronic or digital signatures in particular types of matters. 1. Probable Cause Declarations for Warrants for Arrest Penal Code section 817 addresses the procedures to be used when a peace officer submits a declaration of probable cause to obtain an arrest warrant before criminal charges are filed.7 These warrants are sometimes called Ramey warrants, referring to People v. Ramey (1976) 16 Cal.3d 263. ( Goodwin v. Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 215, 218.) Penal Code section 817 requires the peace officer to submit a sworn written statement in support of the warrant of probable cause. (Pen. Code, § 817(b).) Under section 817(d), the following conditions apply: (1) The declarant shall sign under penalty of perjury his or her declaration in support of the warrant of probable cause for arrest. The declarant’s signature shall be in the form of a digital signature or electronic signature if email or computer server is used for transmission to the magistrate. The proposed warrant and all supporting declarations and attachments shall be transmitted to the magistrate utilizing facsimile transmission equipment, email, or computer server[;] [and] (2) The magistrate shall verify that all the pages sent have been received, that all the pages are legible, and that the declarant’s signature, digital signature, or electronic signature is genuine. As an alternative, under Penal Code section 817(c), the magistrate may accept an oral statement made under penalty of perjury and recorded and transcribed. (See Pen. Code, § 817(c) [the recording and transcript must be certified].) 7 Penal Code section 817 does not apply to bench warrants or arrest warrants that are sought via a criminal complaint. (Pen. Code, § 817(a)(2).) 64 If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant,8 under Penal Code section 817(g), he or she shall do all of the following: (1) Sign the warrant. The magistrate’s signature may be in the form of a digital signature or electronic signature if electronic mail or computer server was used for transmission to the magistrate. (2) Note on the warrant the date and time of the issuance of the warrant. (3) Transmit via facsimile transmission equipment, email, or computer server the signed warrant to the declarant. The warrant, signed by the magistrate and received by the declarant, shall be deemed to be the original warrant. 2. Probable Cause Declarations for Search Warrants: Penal Code Section 1526 Before issuing a search warrant, a magistrate must take the written and signed affidavit of the person seeking the warrant. (Pen. Code, § 1526(a); Powelson v. Superior Court (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 357, 360–361.) Under Penal Code section 1526(c), the following requirements apply: (1) The affiant shall sign under penalty of perjury his or her affidavit in support of probable cause for issuance of a search warrant. The affiant’s signature may be in the form of a digital signature or electronic signature if electronic mail or computer server is used for transmission to the magistrate. (2) The magistrate shall verify that all the pages sent have been received, that all the pages are legible, and that the declarant’s signature, digital signature, or electronic signature is genuine. (3) If the magistrate decides to issue the search warrant, he or she shall do both of the following: (A) Sign the warrant. The magistrate’s signature may be in the form of a digital signature or electronic signature if electronic mail or computer server is used for transmission by the magistrate. (B) Note on the warrant the date and time of the issuance of the warrant. (4) The magistrate shall transmit via facsimile transmission equipment, electronic mail, or computer server, the signed search warrant to the affiant. The search warrant 8 The magistrate shall issue a warrant “only if he or she is satisfied after reviewing the declaration that there exists probable cause that the offense described in the declaration has been committed and that the defendant described in the declaration has committed the offense.” (Pen. Code, § 817(a)(1).) 65 signed by the magistrate and received by the affiant shall be deemed to be the original warrant. The original warrant and any affidavits or attachments in support thereof shall be returned as provided in [Penal Code] Section 1534. Alternatively, in lieu of a written affidavit, a “magistrate may take an oral statement under oath if the oath is made under penalty of perjury, and recorded and transcribed. The transcribed statement shall be deemed an affidavit . . . . The recording of the oral statement and the transcribed statement shall be certified by the magistrate receiving it and shall be filed with the clerk of the court.” (Pen. Code, § 1526(b).) Alternatively, “the sworn oral statement shall be recorded by a certified court reporter and the transcript of the statement shall be certified by the reporter, after which the magistrate receiving it shall certify the transcript which shall be filed with the clerk of the court.” ( Id .) 3. Electronic Signatures on Notices to Appear Vehicle Code section 40500 addresses nonfelony traffic violations and requires that the arresting officer prepare in triplicate a written notice to appear in court. (Veh. Code, § 40500(a); id. at § 40600(a) [similar provisions].) The arresting officer must deliver a copy to the arrested person, and then must file copies with the court, and with the commissioner, chief of police, sheriff, or other superior officer of the arresting officer. ( Id. , §§ 40500(d), 40506.) A notice to appear may also be issued for nontraffic infraction and misdemeanor offenses. (Pen. Code, §§ 853.5, 853.6.) Penal Code section 959.1(d)–(f) authorizes a court to receive and file an electronically transmitted notice to appear issued on a form approved by the Judicial Council if the following conditions are met: (1) The notice to appear is issued and transmitted by a law enforcement agency pursuant to [specified Penal Code or Vehicle Code sections]. (2) The court has all of the following: (A) The ability to receive the notice to appear in electronic format. (B) The facility to electronically store an electronic copy and the data elements of the notice to appear for the statutory period of record retention. (C) The ability to reproduce the electronic copy of the notice to appear and those data elements in printed form upon demand and payment of any costs involved. (3) The issuing agency has the ability to reproduce the notice to appear in physical form upon demand and payment of any costs involved. 66 A notice to appear received under Penal Code section 959.1(d) is deemed to have been filed when it has been accepted by the court and is in the form approved by the Judicial Council. (Pen. Code, § 959.1(e).) “If transmitted in electronic form, the notice to appear is deemed to have been signed by the defendant if it includes a digitized facsimile of the defendant’s signature on the notice to appear. A notice to appear filed electronically under [section 959.1(d)] need not be subscribed by the citing officer. An electronically submitted notice to appear need not be verified by the citing officer with a declaration under penalty of perjury if the electronic form indicates which parts of the notice are verified by that declaration and the name of the officer making the declaration.” ( Id ., § 959.1(f).) A Judicial Council notice to appear form that is issued when a person is arrested for misdemeanor or infraction violations of the Vehicle Code or for nontraffic misdemeanors or infractions serves as a complaint. (Veh. Code, § 40500(b); Pen. Code, § 853.9(b).) Under rule 4.103 of the California Rules of Court, the Judicial Council has approved the following notice to appear forms: Form TR-106 Continuation of Notice to Appear Form TR-108 Continuation of Citation Form TR-115 Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear Form TR-120 Nontraffic Notice to Appear Form TR-130 Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear Form TR-135 Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear Form TR-145 Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear For more information about these forms, see the Judicial Council’s form instructions, in TR- INST, Notice to Appear and Related Forms (Instructions), at www.courts.ca.gov/documents/trinst.pdf. 6.2.3 Signatures on Scanned Documents Government Code section 68150(a) authorizes the preservation and maintenance of trial court records in electronic form. Under this provision, trial courts may convert their paper records to electronic form by scanning them to create digital images. The act of scanning an original signature results in a digitized signature. This digitized signature shall have the same validity, and the same legal force and effect, as the original signature. This is true generally for the electronic signatures of parties and others on documents submitted to the courts, and for the electronic signatures of judicial officers and superior courts (addressed above, in sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2). 67 7. Exhibits Management Exhibits management is a fundamental responsibility of records managers. Accepting, maintaining, returning, and disposing of exhibits is generally the responsibility of the clerk of the court, unless the court orders otherwise. Each trial court is encouraged to develop local procedures for managing exhibits, which address:  Scheduling periodic physical inventories of exhibits;  Handling of dangerous or biohazardous exhibits;  Handling of exhibits with a high monetary value;  Transferring custody of exhibits between courtroom staff and exhibits custodians;  Monitoring the movement of exhibits from courtrooms to vaults or exhibit rooms;  Permitting the public viewing of exhibits;  Accounting for lost exhibits;  Alerting parties when exhibits are available to be returned or destroyed;  Managing exhibits while cases are under appeal;  Requesting extensions of time for the court to retain exhibits; and  Notifying entities designated by the Judicial Council of the court’s intent to destroy felony or unlimited civil records, pursuant to rule 10.856 of the California Rules of Court. Pursuant to rule 2.400(c)(1) of the California Rules of Court, “[t]he clerk must not release any exhibit except on order of the court. The clerk must require a signed receipt for a released exhibit.” 7.1 Exhibits in Civil Cases Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1952, the court clerk must retain any exhibit introduced or filed in a civil action or proceeding for 60 days following the judgment or the final determination of any appeal. (See also, Code Civ. Proc., § 1952.2 [procedure for ordering the return of trial exhibits]; id ., § 1952.3 [procedure for ordering the destruction or disposition of exhibits introduced at trial or at a posttrial hearing, or filed in the action or proceeding; five to ten years].) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1952.3, any exhibit contained in a sealed civil case file must be retained for an additional two years beyond the date that they would have been destroyed had the records not been sealed. 68 7.2 Exhibits in Criminal Cases All exhibits that have been introduced or filed in any criminal action or proceeding “shall be retained by the clerk of the court who shall establish a procedure to account for the exhibits properly, subject to [Penal Code] Sections 1417.2 and 1417.3 until final determination of the action or proceedings.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.) “[T]he exhibits shall thereafter be distributed or disposed of as provided in [Pen. Code, § 1417 et seq.].” (Pen. Code, § 1417.) 7.2.1 Dangerous and Biohazardous Exhibits Courts may adopt local orders or rules that address the custodial responsibilities for managing exhibits that are dangerous or contain biohazardous materials. Courts may make arrangements with prosecuting agencies or local law enforcement agencies to secure such exhibits in their own secure evidence lockers or vaults, as an alternative to having court staff handle these dangerous items. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, §§ 1417.3, 1417.9; Atty. Gen. of Cal., Postconviction DNA Testing: Recommendations for Retention, Storage and Disposal of Biological Evidence , at p. 6 [recommendations for courts unable to properly retain evidence containing biological material].) 7.2.1.1 Exhibits That Pose a Security, Storage, or Safety Problem (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(a)) The clerk may recommend that the court order the return of exhibits that pose security, storage, or safety problems prior to the final determination of a criminal action or proceeding. (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(a).) “If an exhibit by its nature is severable, the court shall order the clerk to retain a portion of the exhibit not exceeding three pounds by weight or one cubic foot by volume and shall order the return of the balance of the exhibit to the district attorney.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(a).) “The clerk, upon court order, shall substitute a full and complete photographic record of any exhibit or part of any exhibit returned to the state under this section. The party to whom the exhibit is being returned shall provide the photographic record.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(a).) 7.2.1.2 Exhibits That Are Toxic (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(b)) “Exhibits toxic by their nature that pose a health hazard to humans shall be introduced to the court in the form of a photographic record and a written chemical analysis certified by competent authority.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(b).) “Where the court finds that good cause exists to depart from this procedure, toxic exhibits may be brought into the courtroom and introduced. However, following introduction of the 69 exhibit, the person or persons previously in possession of the exhibit shall take responsibility for it and the court shall not be required to store the exhibit.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.3(b).) 7.2.1.3 Dangerous or Deadly Weapons, Narcotics or Poisonous Drugs, Explosives, or Any Property the Possession of Which is Prohibited by Law (Pen. Code, § 1417.6(a)) and Biological Material for DNA Testing (Pen. Code, § 1417.9(a)) Penal Code section 1417.6 addresses the proper disposition of other dangerous exhibits. Section 1417.6 applies to “any dangerous or deadly weapons, narcotic or poisonous drugs, explosives, or any property of any kind or character whatsoever the possession of which is prohibited by law and that was used by a defendant in the commission of the crime of which the defendant was convicted, or with which the defendant was armed or that the defendant had upon his or her person at the time of the defendant’s arrest.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.6(a).) “Any of this property introduced or filed as an exhibit, by order of the trial court, shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of under the conditions provided in the order no sooner than 60 days following the final determination of the criminal action or proceeding.”( Ibid .) Penal Code section 1417.9 applies to exhibits containing or including biological material. Subdivision (a) directs that, “[n]otwithstanding any other law . . . , the appropriate governmental entity shall retain any object or material that contains or includes biological material that is secured in connection with a criminal case for the period of time that any person remains incarcerated in connection with that case. (Pen. Code, § 1417.9(a).) The governmental entity may “determine how the evidence is retained pursuant to this section, provided that the evidence is retained in a condition suitable for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing.” ( Ibid .; see Atty. Gen. of Cal., Postconviction DNA Testing: Recommendations for Retention, Storage and Disposal of Biological Evidence , supra , at p. 7 [recommendations for proper long-term storage of biological evidence].) Under Penal Code section 1417.9(b), a “governmental entity may dispose of any object or material that contains or includes biological material before the expiration of the period of time described in subdivision (a) [above] if all of the conditions set forth [in subdivision (b)] are met.” Notice requirements specified in section 1417.9(b) are “absolute and shall not be waived.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.9(c).) 70 7.2.2 Unclaimed Exhibits of Money or Currency or Other Property, and Photographs of Minors Found to be Harmful Matter 7.2.2.1 Unclaimed Exhibits of Money or Currency (Pen. Code, §§ 1417.5(c)(4) & 1420–1422) If the party entitled to an exhibit of money or currency fails to apply for the return of the exhibit prior to the date for disposition under Penal Code section 1417.5, the exhibit shall be disposed of pursuant to Penal Code section 1420. (Pen. Code, § 1417.5(c)(4).) Under Penal Code section 1420, “[a]ll money received by a district attorney or clerk of the court in any criminal action or proceeding, the owner or owners of which are unknown, and which remains unclaimed in the possession of the district attorney or clerk of the court after final judgment in the criminal action or proceeding, shall be deposited with the county treasurer. Upon the expiration of two years after the deposit, the county treasurer shall [publish] a notice pursuant to Penal Code section 1421 . . . once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county.” “The notice shall state the amount of money, the criminal action or proceeding in which the money was received by the district attorney or clerk of the court, the fund in which it is held and that it is proposed that the money will become the property of the county on a designated date not less than 45 days nor more than 60 days after the first publication of the notice.” (Pen. Code, § 1421.) “Unless someone files a verified complaint seeking to recover all, or a designated part, of the money in a court of competent jurisdiction within the county in which the notice is published, and serves a copy of the complaint and the summons issued thereon upon the county treasurer before the date designated in the notice, upon that date the money becomes the property of the county and shall be transferred by the treasurer to the general fund.” (Pen. Code, § 1422.) 7.2.2.2 Unclaimed Exhibits of Other Property (Pen. Code, § 1417.5(c)(1)–(c)(3)) If the party entitled to an exhibit that is not money or currency fails to apply for the return of the exhibit prior to the date for disposition under Penal Code section 1417.5, the procedures specified in section 1417.5(c)(1)–(c)(3) apply. (Pen. Code, § 1417.5(c).) Under Penal Code section 1417.5(c)(1), unclaimed exhibits “of stolen or embezzled property other than money shall be disposed of pursuant to court order as provided in [Penal Code section] 1417.6.” Section 1417.6(a) directs that covered exhibits “shall be, by order of the trial court, destroyed or otherwise disposed of under the conditions provided in the order no sooner than 60 days following the final determination of the criminal action or proceeding.” 71 Under Penal Code section 1417.5(c)(2), unclaimed exhibit of other property—property which does not consist of money or currency, and which was not stolen or embezzled—if it has value, shall . . . be transferred to the appropriate county agency for sale to the public in the same manner [as] . . . [a] sale of surplus personal property [conducted pursuant to Government Code section 25500 et seq.]. If the county determines that any property is needed for a public use, the property may be retained by the county and need not be sold.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.5(c)(2).) Under Penal Code section 1417.5(c)(3), however, if the court determines that the unclaimed exhibit of other property has “no value at public sale,” the exhibit “shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of pursuant to court order.” 7.2.2.3 Exhibits That Are Photographs of Minors Found to Be Harmful Matter (Pen. Code, § 1417.8(a)) If a court finds that any photograph of any minor that has been introduced or filed as an exhibit in any criminal proceeding specified in Penal Code section 1417.8(b) “is harmful matter, as defined in [Penal Code section] 313,” the court shall direct that the photograph be handled as specified in Penal Code section 1417.8(a). Under Penal Code section 1417.8(a)(1), “[p]rior to the final determination of the action or proceeding, the photograph . . . shall be available only to the parties or to a person named in a court order to receive the photograph.” Under Penal Code section 1417.8(a)(2), “[a]fter the final determination of the action or proceeding, the photograph shall be preserved with the permanent record maintained by the clerk of the court. The photograph may be disposed of or destroyed after preservation through any appropriate photographic or electronic medium. If the photograph is disposed of, it shall be rendered unidentifiable before the disposal. No person shall have access to the photograph unless that person has been named in a court order to receive the photograph. Any copy, negative, reprint, or other duplication of the photograph in the possession of the state, a state agency, the defendant, or an agent of the defendant, shall be delivered to the clerk of the court for disposal whether or not the defendant was convicted of the offense.” 7.2.3 Death Penalty Exhibits In cases where the death penalty is imposed, exhibits may be destroyed “30 days after the date of execution of sentence.” (Pen. Code, § 1417.1(d)(1).) But, if the defendant dies while awaiting execution, exhibits may be destroyed “one year after the date of the defendant’s death.” ( Id ., § 1417.1(d)(2).) 72 8. Public Calendars, Indexes, and Registers of Action: Minimum Standards Court calendars are lists of cases to be heard on specified dates in specified court departments, prepared for use by the clerk of the court and other courtroom personnel in calling cases in an orderly manner. (See, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.507(b)(1).) They provide the public with the ability to research and locate court events for a particular individual or case being heard on a given day. Public court calendars may be discarded after they are no longer of use. Indexes are important records of all public cases filed in the court, except infractions and confidential case types, and serve as a cross-reference of case names to the case numbers. (Gov. Code, § 69842; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.507(b)(2).) Courts are encouraged to create a linkage, preferably automated, between new records entered in case management systems and entries in public indexes. Ideally, a public index entry is created at the same time a new case is filed with the court. Indexes available to the public shall not contain information restricted by statute or rule of court. (See, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.507(c) [listing information that “must be excluded from a court’s electronic . . . index”].) Registers of actions, also known as dockets, may provide “the title of each cause,” “the date of its commencement,” a chronological list of “every subsequent proceeding in the action with its date,” as well as some or all of the documents filed in the court. (Gov. Code, § 69845; see also, id. , § 69845.5 [Alternatively, the court clerk may “preserv[e] all the court records filed, lodged, or maintained in connection with the case”]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.507(b)(3) [“The register of actions must be a summary of every proceeding in a case”].) Since the register of actions represents the history of activities in a case, it is vital that it be updated regularly and with as much information as possible. Under rule 2.503(b)(1) of the California Rules of Court, a court that maintains its calendars, indexes, and registers of actions “in electronic form must provide [the public] electronic access to them, both remotely and at the courthouse, to the extent it is feasible to do so.” 8.1 Minimum Content for Electronically Accessible Court Calendars, Indexes, and Registers of Action Rule 2.507(b) of the California Rules of Court specifies the minimum content requirements for electronically accessible court calendars, indexes, and registers of action. The electronic court calendar must include:  Date of court calendar; 73  Time of calendared event;  Court department number;  Case number; and  Case title (unless made confidential by law). The electronic index must include:  Case title (unless made confidential by law);  Party names (unless made confidential by law);  Party type;  Date on which the case was filed; and  Case number. The register of actions must be a summary of every proceeding in a case, in compliance with Government Code section 69845, and must include:  Date case commenced;  Case number;  Case type;  Case title (unless made confidential by law);  Party names (unless made confidential by law);  Party type;  Date of each activity; and  Description of each activity. 8.2 Information that Must Be Excluded From Electronically Accessible Court Calendars, Indexes, and Registers of Actions Under rule 2.507(c) of the California Rules of Court, the following information must be excluded from a court’s electronic calendar, index, and register of actions:  Social security number;  Any financial information;  Arrest warrant information;  Search warrant information;  Victim information;  Witness information;  Ethnicity;  Age;  Gender;  Government-issued identification card numbers (i.e., military); 74  Driver’s license number; and  Date of birth. 75 9. Disaster Recovery Planning and Procedures 9.1 Planning for a Disaster Effective disaster recovery planning and procedures are critical to court records management. In the event of a disaster, a well-designed and well-managed recovery plan can expedite the return to normal business operations, allowing access to court records for the court and the general public. Disaster planning, response, and recovery are key components of a comprehensive records management program. 9.2 Response to Disasters Courts are encouraged to take decisive action after a disaster. As soon as it is safe to enter the affected area, the first priority is to assess the scope and nature of the damage to equipment, facilities, and records. It is critical to document the location, type, and quantity of records affected, and the nature and severity of damage. Once this is accomplished, the prioritization of the recovery plan can proceed. The court’s continuity of operations plan (COOP) prioritizes the functions that are critical if there is a prolonged disruption to a court’s normal business operations.9 The COOP can be a helpful guide in prioritizing records recovery efforts.10 A much different response, but no less urgent, would be called for if a disaster were to affect a remote records facility that holds infrequently accessed archival records. These records may not be needed to resume court operations, but the court has an obligation to safeguard all records under its control. Data redundancy is a key feature of any effective disaster recovery plan. As this concept relates to court records, redundancy can be created by storing a complete copy of film, magnetic, optical, and digital data at a secure facility at least 50 miles from the court. Several companies specialize in this kind of records storage and will work with the court to create a regular schedule to deliver backup copies of court data to the off-site facility. Cloud computing is another alternative.11 Where feasible, courts may wish to consider digitizing their records, as part of their continuity of operations and information technology disaster 9 To create and maintain a COOP and associated emergency plans, courts may use the optional online planning system available at coop.courts.ca.gov. For information about the online planning system, related guidance, and workshops, courts may email the Judicial Council’s Emergency Planning and Security Coordination unit (at EPSCU@jud.ca.gov). 10 Additionally, courts may find helpful resources regarding information technology disaster recovery planning on the California Courts website. (See Judicial Council of Cal., Information Technology Advisory Com. Rep., Judicial Branch Operations: Disaster Recovery Framework Guide (Feb. 15, 2018), at https://jcc.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=5810581&GUID=2AC09057-3022-4734-B270-9CC777EF842C . 11 See Disaster Recovery Framework , supra , attach. A, § 5 (supported and recommended backup technologies); id ., § 6.1 (backup methods). 76 recovery planning, to ensure recovery and timely access in the event of a disaster or other emergency. 9.3 Disaster Recovery In the event of a disaster, it is critical to salvage records efficiently and economically while attempting to preserve their integrity for future use. Recovery seeks to salvage or reconstruct case-related information on active files and preserve closed records for at least the minimum retention period required. The severity of the underlying disaster may make such efforts impractical or impossible, but a full assessment should be made of the condition of court records prior to making decisions about recovery.  Preliminary concerns: Records managers must thoroughly understand the content of the records inventory, including the affected record series and their retention and disposition dates, and their relative importance for the court’s daily operations.  Salvage operations: When records are damaged (e.g., soaked, burned, or buried), effective salvage operations require coordination and speed. Mitigating and reversing damage becomes more difficult the longer the salvage effort is delayed. Creating a master list of the damaged records launches the salvage effort. If the records inventory is complete and current, this list will be relatively easy to compile. Determining whether the damaged records can be duplicated from other sources (e.g., microfilm or optical discs) is the next step. If copies of microfilmed and electronic records are stored at an alternate location or in the cloud, any damaged working copies of microfilm or electronic records may be reconstructed from the off-site originals. Salvageable records should be examined to determine what can be saved, what was lost or irreparably damaged, and what can be destroyed. Records managers should catalog salvageable records to keep track of their identity and whereabouts throughout the salvage process. After the preliminary analysis and inventory, salvage efforts may begin. The Judicial Council may be able to assist courts with locating specialists, equipment, and supplies needed to address the specific type of damage to the records. The proper procedures to follow for different kinds of damage are available in many records management sources. From a records management perspective, the primary objective of a disaster recovery effort is to salvage active case records and court orders from closed cases. There may be other permanent, intrinsically valuable documents, however, that also deserve priority attention in salvage operations. Courts are legally required to maintain these permanent records, even if they are not vital records, because of their continuing historical, legal, and aesthetic value. (See, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855.) Salvageable permanent records that have 77 enduring value shall not be authorized for destruction. Courts may postpone restoring these records, however, once their condition has been stabilized if delayed application of conservation techniques will not cause further deterioration. Information related to disaster recovery efforts may be updated periodically, and preferably annually. The records inventory, storage area diagrams, contact lists (including names, addresses, and telephone numbers), as well as the court’s COOP and other policies and procedures, are important source documents in any disaster recovery effort. 78 10. Public Access to Court Records Court records that accurately and officially reflect the work of the court (e.g., court orders and judgments, official minutes, the various documents filed in or received by the court, and the evidence admitted in court proceedings) are presumed to be open and accessible to the public, unless they are confidential as a matter of law or are sealed by court order. Confidential and sealed records are described, below, in section 10.3, “Confidential and Sealed Records.” 10.1. Access to Electronic Court Records Rules 2.503–2.507 of the California Rules of Court are intended to provide the public with reasonable access to trial court records that are maintained in electronic form while protecting privacy interests . (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 2.500(a), 2.503(a); see also, id ., rule 2.502(3), (6) [defining “court record” and “electronic record” for the purpose of these rules].) These rules are not intended to give the public a right of access to any electronic record that the public is not otherwise legally entitled to access ( id ., rule 2.500(c)), and they do not create any right of access to records sealed by court order or made confidential by law ( id ., rule 2.503(a)). The rules also do not apply to parties, their attorneys, or other persons or entities that may be entitled to have access to certain court records by statute or rule.12 Courthouse and Remote Access to Electronic Records Under rule 2.503(a) of the California Rules of Court, “[a]ll electronic records must be made reasonably available to the public in some form, whether in electronic or in paper form, except those that are sealed by court order or made confidential by law.” (See also, Gov. Code, § 68150( l ).) A court that maintains the following records in electronic form must provide the public electronic access to them, both remotely and at the courthouse, to the extent it is feasible to do so: (1) registers of actions (as defined in Gov. Code, § 69845), calendars, and indexes in all cases; and (2) all civil case records except those listed in rule 2.503(c)(1)–(c)(11) of the California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.503(a)(1), (b).) 12 Effective January 1, 2019, the Judicial Council adopted rules 2.515–2.528 and rules 2.540–2.545 of the California Rules of Court, governing remote access to electronic records by other people and entities. Specifically, rules 2.515–2.528 govern remote access to electronic records by a party, a party’s designee, a party’s attorney, a court-appointed person, an authorized person working in the same legal organization as a party’s attorney, and an authorized person working in a qualified legal services project providing brief legal services. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.515(b).) Rules 2.540–2.545 govern remote access to electronic records by specified government entities. (See id ., rule 2.540(b) [listing government entities and authorized levels of remote access].) 79 Access to Registers of Action, Calendars, and Indexes Courts that maintain records in electronic form must, to the extent feasible, provide—both at the courthouse and remotely—public access to registers of action, calendars, and indexes. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.503(b)(1).) The minimum contents for court calendars, indexes, and registers of action that are available to the public by electronic means are prescribed by rule. (See rule 2.507(b).) The same rule specifies information that must be excluded from court calendars, indexes, and registers of action that are available to the public by electronic means; the information to be excluded includes social security numbers, financial information, arrest and search warrant information, victim and witness information, ethnicity, age, gender, government (i.e., military) identification card numbers, driver’s license numbers, and dates of birth. (See rule 2.507(c).) 10.2 Remote Access Allowed in High-Profile Criminal Cases One of the most time-consuming tasks for court staff is serving the demand for court records from the media and public interested in a high-profile criminal case. The use of technology can assist the court in dealing with the large number of requests for court records pertaining to these types of cases. Notwithstanding the general restriction in rule 2.503(c) against providing remote access for the public to electronic records in criminal proceedings, under rule 2.503(e), the presiding judge or a designated judge may order the records of a high-profile criminal case to be posted on the court’s website to enable faster and easier access to these records by the media and public. Rule 2.503(e)(1) specifies several factors that judges must consider before taking such action. Additionally, prior to posting, staff should, to the extent feasible, redact any confidential or personal identifying information contained in the court documents. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.503(e)(2) [recommending, to the extent feasible, redaction of the following information from records to which remote access is granted: “driver license numbers; dates of birth; social security numbers; Criminal Identification and Information numbers and National Crime Information Center numbers; addresses and phone numbers of parties, victims, witnesses, and court personnel; medical or psychiatric information; financial information; account numbers”].) Five days’ notice must be provided to the parties and the public before the court makes a determination to provide remote access under this rule. Notice to the public may be accomplished by posting notice on the court’s website. ( Id ., rule 2.503(e)(3).) Once issued, a copy of the order permitting remote access must also be posted on the website and a copy must be sent to the Judicial Council. ( Id ., rule 2.503(e)(4).) 80 10.3 Confidential and Sealed Records 10.3.1 Confidential Records A nonexhaustive list of confidential records that are exempt from the presumption of public disclosure by statute, regulation, rule of court, or case law is provided below.13 This list is divided into the following court record classifications: criminal; civil; family and juvenile; probate; protective orders; and jury information. As indicated below, some records are confidential by law in all circumstances, while others may be sealed by court order in particular circumstances and then are treated as confidential.14 Statutes and rules governing the sealing of records are discussed in section 10.3.2., “Sealed Records.” Criminal Case Records Records that are confidential 1. Indigent defendant requests for funds: A request for funds for payment of investigators, experts, and others to aid in presenting or preparing the defense in certain murder cases is confidential. This exemption applies to defendants in capital cases and defendants in cases under Penal Code section 190.05. (Pen. Code, § 987.9.) 2. Arrest records: The arrest record for a defendant found to be factually innocent is confidential. (Pen. Code, §§ 851.8, 851.85.) 3. Psychiatric records or reports: Reports prepared at the request of defense counsel to determine whether to enter or withdraw a plea based on insanity or to present a defense based on the defendant’s mental or emotional condition are confidential. (Evid. Code, § 1017.) Additionally, documents submitted to a court pursuant to Penal Code section 1367 et seq., addressing a defendant’s competence before trial or after conviction, are presumptively confidential, except as otherwise provided by law. (Pen. Code, § 1369.5.) Other psychiatric reports prepared at a court’s request are presumed open to the public. (See Evid. Code, § 1017; Evid. Code, § 730 [report by a court-appointed expert]; Pen. Code, § 288.1 [report on sex offender prior to suspension of sentence]; and Pen. Code, §§ 1026, 1027 [report on persons pleading not guilty by reason of insanity].) 4. Probation reports: Probation reports filed with the court are confidential except that, under Penal Code section 1203.05, they may be inspected and copied by:  Any person, for up to 60 days from the date judgment is pronounced, or probation is granted or, if a report arises out of a previous arrest, from the date the subsequent accusatory pleading is filed until 60 days from the date judgment is pronounced or probation granted;  Any person, at any time, pursuant to a court order; 13 See also, Appendix 1, containing a more complete list of court records that are designated confidential or are eligible to be sealed by statute or rule. 14 In this section, we treat the two categories the same. In some instances, therefore, records described here as confidential would only qualify as such if a sealing order were entered. 81  The general public, if the court on its own motion orders that a report shall be open or its contents disclosed;  Any person authorized or required by law to inspect or receive copies of the report;  The district attorney of the county at any time; and  The subject of the report at any time. 5. Defendant’s Statement of Assets (form CR-115): This mandatory Judicial Council financial disclosure form may only be inspected or copied as permitted by court order, or by a person authorized or required by law to inspect or copy it. (See Pen. Code, §§ 1202.4(f)(7), 1203.05(b)–(d).) 6. Presentencing diagnostic reports under Penal Code section 1203.03: The report and recommendation from the 90-day Department of Corrections presentencing diagnosis should be released only to defendant or defense counsel, the probation officer, and the prosecuting attorney. After disposition of the case, only those persons listed immediately above, the court, and the Department of Corrections may access the report. Disclosure to anyone else is prohibited unless the defendant consents. (Pen. Code, § 1203.03(b).) 7. Victim impact statements: Victim impact statements filed with the court must remain under seal until imposition of judgment and sentence, except that the court, the probation officer, and counsel for the parties may review such statements not more than two days before the date set for imposition of judgment and sentence. (Pen. Code, § 1191.15(b).) A “court shall not permit any person to duplicate, copy, or reproduce” a victim impact statement. (Pen. Code, § 1191.15(c).) 8. Criminal history information rap sheets: Summaries of criminal history information are confidential. ( Westbrook v. Los Angeles (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 157, 164; Pen. Code, §§ 11075–11076, 11105, and 13300–13326.) Public officials have a duty to preserve the confidentiality of a defendant’s criminal history. ( Craig v. Municipal Court (1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 69, 76.) Unauthorized disclosure of criminal history violates a defendant’s privacy rights under the California Constitution. (Ibid.) Courts have upheld the confidentiality assigned to criminal history records. (See, e.g., Westbrook , supra , 27 Cal.App.4th at p. 160 [private company denied access to municipal court computer data base compilation].) 9. Reports concerning prisoners who have mental health disorders: Reports under Penal Code section 4011.6 to evaluate whether prisoners have mental health disorders are confidential. (Pen. Code, § 4011.6.) 10. Criminal cases returned to the juvenile court for disposition: For cases transferred from juvenile court to a court of criminal jurisdiction pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, in specified circumstances, the criminal court may return the case to juvenile court for disposition. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 707.5(b).) Where this occurs, the clerk of the criminal court must “deliver to the clerk of the juvenile court all copies of the minor’s record in criminal court and shall obliterate the person’s name for any index maintained in criminal court.” ( Id ., § 707.5(f).) The clerk of the juvenile court shall maintain the criminal court records as if they were juvenile court records until such time as it may issue an order sealing the records. ( Ibid .) 82 Records that may be confidential 1. Police reports: There is no specific statute, rule, or decision addressing the confidentiality of a police report once it has become a “court record.” Generally speaking, a police report that has been used in a judicial proceeding or is placed in a court file is presumed to be open to the public. Many police reports, however, contain sensitive or personal information about crime victims, witnesses, and other third parties. Penal Code section 1054.2(a)(1) provides that defense counsel may not disclose the address or telephone number of a victim or witness to the defendant or his or her family. Similarly, law enforcement agencies are prohibited from disclosing the address and phone number of a witness or victim in an alleged offense to an arrestee or a potential defendant. (Pen. Code, § 841.5(a).) We suggest that courts should require that personal information be redacted before the report is filed with the court or used in a judicial proceeding. 2. Search warrants: It is within the court’s discretion to seal the court documents and records of a search warrant until the warrant is executed and returned, or until the warrant expires. (Pen. Code, § 1534(a).) Thereafter, if the warrant has been executed, the documents and records shall be open to the public as a judicial record. ( Ibid .) Evidence Code sections 1040–1041 establish exceptions to the public status of executed search warrants; these provisions allow public entities to refuse disclosure of confidential official information and an informant’s identity when disclosure is against the public interest. When a search warrant is valid on its face, a public entity bringing a criminal proceeding may establish the search’s legality without revealing to the defendant any confidential official information or an informant’s identity. (Evid. Code, § 1042(b).) When a search warrant affidavit is fully or partially sealed pursuant to Evidence Code sections 1040–1042, the defense may move to quash or traverse the search warrant. The court should conduct an in-camera hearing following the procedure established in People v. Hobbs (1994) 7 Cal.4th 948. 3. Identity of sex offense victims: The victim of an alleged sexual offense may request anonymity from the court. Upon a proper showing, the judge may order the identity of the victim in all records and during all proceedings to be either “Jane Doe” or “John Doe” if the judge finds that such an order is reasonably necessary to protect the alleged victim’s privacy and that such measures will not unduly prejudice the prosecution or defense. (Pen. Code, § 293.5.) 4. Records from federally funded drug rehabilitation centers: The Code of Federal Regulations provides that information that would disclose the identity of a person receiving treatment for drug or alcohol abuse under a federally funded program is confidential. (42 C.F.R. § 2.12.) For example, the drug court program receives federal funding. Thus any information that would disclose the names of persons in that program appears to be confidential. Notably, the confidentiality provisions governing federally funded programs are quite broad and include information from a program funded in part by special or general revenue sharing programs that receive federal funding. (See 42 C.F.R. § 2.12(b)(3).) 5. Records of arrest or conviction for marijuana possession or other related offense: These records must be destroyed two years from the date of conviction or arrest if there was no 83 conviction. (Health & Saf. Code, § 11361.5(a).) This rule is subject to various exceptions, including for offenders under 18 years of age, written transcriptions of oral testimony in court proceedings and published judicial appellate reports, and records related to an offender’s civil action against a public entity. (See Health & Saf. Code, § 11361.5.) Public agencies are prohibited from using information in records subject to destruction, even if they have not yet been destroyed. (Health & Saf. Code, § 11361.7(b).) Civil Case Records Records that are confidential 1. Fee waiver applications: Applications to proceed without paying court fees and costs are confidential. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.54.) Only “the court and authorized court personnel, any persons authorized by the applicant, and any persons authorized by order of the court” may have access to the application. ( Id ., rule 3.54(a).) No person may reveal any information contained in the application except as authorized by law or order of the court.” ( Ibid .) The order granting a fee waiver, however, is not confidential. 2. Unlawful detainer proceedings: Court records filed in unlawful detainer proceedings are not publicly available, except that the persons specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1161.2(a)(1)(A)–(E) may have access to limited civil case records (including the court file, index, and register of actions). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.2(a).) In addition, access to limited civil records in unlawful detainer proceedings shall be allowed:  Except in cases involving residential property based on section 1161a as indicated in the caption of the complaint, to any other person 60 days after the complaint has been filed if the plaintiff prevails in the action within 60 days of filing the complaint, in which case the clerk shall allow access to any court records in the action. If a default or default judgment is set aside more than 60 days after the complaint was filed, section 1161.2 shall apply as if the complaint had been filed on the date the default or default judgment is set aside (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.2(a)(1)(F));  In the case of a complaint involving residential property based on section 1161a as indicated on the caption of the complaint, to any other person, if 60 days have elapsed since the complaint was filed with the court, and as of that date, judgment against all defendants has been entered for the plaintiff, after a trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.2(a)(1)(G).) An exception excludes records of mobile home park tenancies from this code section; those records are not confidential. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.2(e).) 3. Confidential Statements of Taxpayer or Judgment Debtor Social Security Numbers (forms WG-021, WG-025, and WG-035) in wage garnishment cases: These mandatory Judicial Council forms for use in connection with wage garnishments are confidential.15 4. False Claims Act cases: The documents initially filed in cases brought under the False Claims Act (Gov. Code, § 12650 et seq.) (also called “qui tam” actions) are submitted “in 15 Any Judicial Council form that is now or hereafter labeled or entitled “CONFIDENTIAL” should not be disclosed except as ordered by a judge. 84 camera” and remain under seal for up to 60 days or longer if the court grants an extension. (Gov. Code, § 12652(c).) The complaint and other initial papers should be attached to the Confidential Cover Sheet—False Claims Action (form CM-011). The cover sheet contains a box specifying the date on which the sealing of the initial case records will expire if not extended by court order. 5. Litigants who are participants in the address confidentiality program: A person who is an active participant in the address confidentiality program (Gov. Code, § 6205 et seq.) who is a party in a civil proceeding may proceed using a pseudonym (either John Doe, Jane Doe, or Doe) and may exclude or redact from all pleadings and documents filed in the action other identifying characteristics. (Code Civ. Proc., § 367.3(b); see id ., § 367.3(a)(1) [defining “identifying characteristics”].) A person electing to proceed using a pseudonym in this context must file with the court and serve upon all other parties a confidential information form that includes the protected person’s name and other identifying characteristics being excluded or redacted. The court must keep the confidential information form confidential. ( Id ., § 367.3(b)(1).) “A party filing a pleading, discovery document, or other document in the action shall exclude or redact any identifying characteristics of the protected person ... except for a confidential information form .... ” ( id ., § 367.3(b)(2)(C)(i)), which the party must file with the court and serve on all other parties, and which the court must keep confidential ( id ., § 367.3(b)(2)(C)(ii)). “The responsibility to exclude or redact identifying characteristics of the protected person from documents filed with the court rests solely with the parties and their attorneys. This section does not require the court to review pleadings or other papers for compliance.” ( Id ., § 367.3(b)(3).) “The court, on motion of the protected person, may order a record or part of a record to be filed under seal” in accordance with rules 2.550 and 2.551 of the California Rules of Court. ( Id ., § 367.3(b)(4).) Records that may be confidential 1. Records and documents in attachment cases: At the time of filing, a plaintiff filing suit under the Attachment Law (Code Civ. Proc., § 481.010 et seq.) can request that records in the action not be made publicly available. ( Id ., § 482.050(a).) In such a case, the clerk must maintain the records as confidential until 30 days after the filing of the complaint, or until the filing of the return of service of the notice of hearing and any temporary protective order, or of the writ of attachment if issued without notice, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 482.050(a).) Confidentiality Provisions Relevant to Both Criminal and Civil Cases Records that are confidential 1. Records related to services provided for voluntary or involuntary treatment of mental health disorders or developmental disabilities: Under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 5328 et seq., records related to services provided in the following contexts and under the following code sections are confidential and can be disclosed only to specified recipients: the State Department of State Hospitals (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 4000 et seq.); 85 the State Department of Developmental Services (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 4400 et seq.); services provided to persons with developmental disabilities (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 4500 et seq.); involuntary treatment or conservatorship related to a mental health disorder, impairment due to chronic alcoholism, or use of a controlled substance (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5000 et seq.); voluntary admissions and judicial commitments to mental hospitals (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 6000 et seq.); and admission to county psychiatric hospitals or state hospitals (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 7100 et seq.). 2. Subpoenaed business records: Subpoenaed business records of nonparty entities are confidential until introduced as evidence or entered into the record. (Evid. Code, § 1560(d).) 3. Social security numbers and financial account numbers: California Rules of Court, rule 1.201, imposes a duty on the parties and their attorneys to omit or redact certain identifiers from documents filed in the court’s public file. This responsibility “rests solely with the parties and their attorneys. The court clerk will not review each pleading or other paper for compliance with this [requirement].” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.201(b).) In an appropriate case, on a showing of good cause, a court may order a party filing a document containing redacted identifiers to also file a Confidential Reference List of Identifiers (form MC-120), identifying each item of redacted information and specifying an appropriate reference that uniquely corresponds to it. 4. Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings: In any judicial proceedings in response to a request that the superior court make the findings necessary to support a petition for classification as a special immigrant juvenile, information regarding the child’s immigration status that is not otherwise protected by the state confidentiality laws must remain confidential and must be available for inspection only by the court, the child who is the subject of the proceeding, the parties, the attorneys for the parties, the child’s counsel, and the child’s guardian. (Code Civ. Proc., § 155(c); see also, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.130 [requests for special immigrant juvenile findings]; Judicial Council form FL-356 [“Confidential Request for Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings–Family Law”]; Judicial Council form FL-358 [“Confidential Response to Request for Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings”].) Records that may be confidential 1. Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings: In any judicial proceedings in response to a request that the superior court make the findings necessary to support a petition for classification as a special immigrant juvenile, records of the proceedings that are not otherwise protected by state confidentiality laws may be sealed using the procedure set forth in California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551. (Code Civ. Proc., § 155(d); see also, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.130 [requests for special immigrant juvenile findings]; Judicial Council form FL-356 [“Confidential Request for Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings–Family Law”]; Judicial Council form FL-358 [“Confidential Response to Request for Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings”].) 86 Family and Juvenile Court Records Records that are confidential 1. Juvenile Court records: Welfare and Institutions Code section 827 and California Rules of Court, rule 5.552 , establish broad restrictions on the disclosure of juvenile court case files. They reflect a general policy that, with certain limited exceptions, juvenile court records should remain confidential. ( In re Keisha T. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 220, 231.) By law, juvenile court case files may be inspected only by specified persons (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 827(a)(1)(A)–(a)(1)(P), (a)(1)(R)) and “any other person who may be designated by court order of the judge of the juvenile court upon filing a petition.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 827(a)(1)(Q).) There is an exception to this rule of confidentiality for certain records in cases brought under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, in which the minor is charged with one or more specified violent offenses. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 676(c).) In such cases, when a petition is sustained, the charging petition, the minutes of the proceeding, and the orders of adjudication and disposition shall be available for public inspection (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 676(d)), unless the juvenile court judge enters an order prohibiting disclosure (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 676(e)). Except for records and information enumerated in Welfare and Institutions Code section 676, however, if a record is part of a juvenile court case file, it should be kept confidential and disclosed only as permitted under Welfare and Institutions Code section 827 and California Rules of Court, rule 5.552. Juvenile court records may also be subject to sealing orders under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 389, 781, 781.5, 786, 786.5, and 793. (See also, below, at § 10.3.2, “Sealed Records.”) 2. Immigration status: Juvenile court records should remain confidential regardless of a juvenile’s immigration status. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 831(a).) Juvenile information may not be disclosed or disseminated to federal officials absent a juvenile court order issued upon the filing of a petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 827(a)(P). (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 831(b)–(c).) Juvenile information may not be attached to any documents given to or provided by federal officials absent prior approval of the presiding judge of the juvenile court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 827(a)(4). (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 831(d).) “Juvenile information” includes the “juvenile case file” as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 827(e), and information related to the juvenile, such as the juvenile’s name, date or place of birth, and immigration status. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 831(e).) 3. Dismissed petitions: The court must order sealed all records related to any petition dismissed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 786 that are in the custody of the juvenile court, law enforcement agencies, the probation department, and the Department of Justice. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 786(a).) The procedures for sealing these records are stated in Welfare and Institutions Code section 786 and in rule 5.840 of the California Rules of Court. (See also, Welf. & Inst. Code, § 793(c) [requiring sealing of juvenile court records where petition is dismissed following deferred entry of judgment]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.800(g).) 87 4. Records of adoption proceedings: Documents related to an adoption proceeding are not open to the public. Only the parties, their attorneys, and the Department of Social Services may review the records. The judge can authorize review by a requestor only in “exceptional circumstances and for good cause approaching the necessitous.” (Fam. Code, § 9200(a).) Any party to the proceeding can petition the court to have redacted from the records, before copy or inspection by the public, the name of the birth parents and information tending to identify the birth parents. (Fam. Code, § 9200(b).) 5. Child custody evaluation reports: These reports must be kept in the confidential portion of the court file and are available only to the parties, their attorneys, federal or state law enforcement officers, the licensing entity of a child custody evaluator, judicial officers, court employees, family court facilitators for the county in which the action was filed (or employee or agents of those facilitators), counsel appointed for the child, and any other person upon order of the court for good cause. (Fam. Code, §§ 3025.5(a), 3111(b); see Judicial Council form FL-328 [“ A Notice Regarding Confidentiality of Child Custody Evaluation Report ”]; see also, Welf. & Inst. Code, § 204; Prob. Code, § 1514.5.) 6. Child custody recommending counselor reports: These reports must be kept in the confidential portion of the court file and are available only to the parties, their attorneys, federal or state law enforcement officers, the licensing entity of a child custody evaluator, judicial officers, court employees, family court facilitators for the county in which the action was filed (or employees or agents of those facilitators), counsel appointed for the child, and any other person upon order of the court for good cause. (Fam. Code, § 3025.5(a). See also, id ., § 3183.) 7. Written statements of issues and contentions by counsel appointed for child: These written statements must be kept in the confidential portion of the court file and are available only to the parties, their attorneys, federal or state law enforcement officers, judicial officers, court employees, family court facilitators for the county in which the action was filed (or employees or agents of those facilitators), counsel appointed for the child, and any other person, upon order of the court, for good cause. (Fam. Code, § 3025.5. See also id ., § 3151(b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.242.) 8. Uniform Parentage Act documents: Records in proceedings under the Uniform Parentage Act (Fam. Code, § 7600 et seq.), other than the final judgment, are not open to the public. (Fam. Code, § 7643(a).) If a judge finds that a third party has shown good cause and finds exceptional circumstances, the court may grant that person access to the records. ( Ibid .) This includes records from parentage actions. 9. Family Conciliation Court Law records: Records filed under this part of the Family Code (Fam. Code, § 1800 et seq.) are confidential. The judge of the family conciliation court can grant permission in writing for a party or the party’s counsel to review certain documents. (Fam. Code, § 1818(b).) 10. Proceeding to terminate parental rights: Documents related to such proceedings are confidential; only persons specified by law may review the records. (Fam. Code, § 7805.) 11. Support enforcement and child abduction records: Support enforcement and child abduction records are generally confidential; these records may be disclosed to persons specified by statute only under limited circumstances. In certain instances, the 88 whereabouts of a party or a child must not be revealed to the other party or his or her attorneys. A local child support agency must redact such information from documents filed with the court. (Fam. Code, § 17212.) 12. Income tax returns in support cases: In a proceeding involving child, family, or spousal support, if a judge finds that it is relevant to the case to retain a party’s tax return, the tax return must be sealed and maintained as a confidential record of the court. (Fam. Code, § 3552(c).) If the judge “finds that the tax return is not relevant to disposition of the case, all copies of the tax return shall be returned to the party who submitted it.” ( Ibid .) Probate Case Records Records that are confidential 1. Confidential Guardian Screening Form (form GC-212): This mandatory Judicial Council form regarding the proposed guardian is confidential. It is used by the court and by persons or agencies designated by the court to assist in determining whether a proposed guardian should be appointed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.1001(c).) 2. Confidential Supplemental Information (form GC-312): This form regarding a proposed conservatee is confidential. It shall be separate and distinct from the form for the petition. The form shall be made available only to parties, persons given notice of the petition who have requested this supplemental information, or who have appeared in the proceedings, their attorneys, and the court. The court has the discretion to release the information to others if it would serve the interest of the conservatee. The court clerk shall make provisions for limiting the disclosure of the supplemental information exclusively to persons entitled thereto. (Prob. Code, § 1821(a); see also, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.1050(c).) 3. Capacity declarations (forms GC-335 and GC-335A): If these forms are filed with or as attachments to form GC-312, they are confidential under Probate Code section 1821(a). If filed separately, they are confidential under section 56.13 of the Civil Code. (Civ. Code, § 56.13.) 4. Confidential Conservator Screening Form (form GC-314): This mandatory Judicial Council form is confidential. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.1050(c).) 5. Reports regarding proposed conservatorship or guardianship: An investigative report created pursuant to Probate Code section 1513 or 1543 concerning a proposed guardianship is confidential and shall be made available only to persons who have been served in the action (generally, parents or legal custodians of a child) or their attorneys. (Prob. Code, §§ 1513(d), 1543(b).) To the extent confidential family court records related to the child’s best interest are released to the probate court or investigator, those records must remain confidential under section 1514.5. An investigative report created pursuant to Probate Code section 1826 regarding a proposed conservatorship is confidential and shall be made available only to the petitioner, the proposed conservatee, other parties, persons given notice of the petition who have requested the report, or who have appeared in the proceedings, their attorneys, and the court. (Prob. Code, § 1826(c).) The court has the discretion to release the information to others if it would serve the interest of the 89 conservatee. ( Ibid .) The court clerk shall make provisions for limiting the disclosure of the reports on guardianships and conservatorships exclusively to persons entitled thereto. (Prob. Code, §§ 1513(d), 1826(c).) The written report of a regional center’s assessment of a proposed limited or general conservatee with developmental disabilities is also confidential and shall be made available only to those persons specified by statute unless the court determines release of the report would serve the interests of the conservatee. (Prob. Code, § 1827.5(d)–(e).) 6. Investigator’s review reports in conservatorships: These reports are confidential. (Prob. Code, § 1851(e).) The information in the reports may be made available only to parties, persons identified in Probate Code section 1851(b), persons given notice of the petition who have requested the report or who have appeared in the proceeding, their attorneys, and the court. The court has the discretion to release the information to others if it would serve the interests of the conservatee. The clerk shall make provisions for limiting the disclosure of the report exclusively to persons entitled thereto. (Prob. Code, § 1851(e).) Subdivision (b) of section 1851 provides for special restricted treatment of attachments containing confidential medical information and confidential information from the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS). Although the attachments are not mentioned in subdivision (e), it is recommended—to be consistent with subdivision (b)—that they be treated as confidential and made available only to the conservator, conservatee, and their attorneys. The report of an investigation in response to an order provisionally granting a petition to transfer a conservatorship from another state is also confidential. (Prob. Code, §§ 1851.1(d), 2002.) 7. Confidential Guardianship Status Report (form GC-251): A report submitted by a court- appointed guardian under Probate Code section 1513.2 is confidential and must be made available only to persons served in the proceedings or their attorneys. (Prob. Code, § 1513.2(c).) 8. Initial and annual certification by counsel of their qualifications for appointment in conservatorship and guardianship proceedings (form GC-010): The form states that it is confidential and for court use only. It is required by rules 7.1101(c)(4) and 7.1105 of the California Rules of Court. The certifications and any supporting documentation submitted to the court “must be maintained confidentially by the court. They must not be lodged or filed in a case file.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.1105(e).) Protective Orders Records that are confidential 1. Confidential CLETS Information (form CLETS-001): A Judicial Council form has been developed for petitioners in protective order proceedings to use to submit information about themselves and the respondents to be entered through the CLETS into the California Restraining and Protective Order System (CARPOS) (formerly known as the Domestic Violence Restraining Order System), a statewide database used to enforce protective orders. (See Fam. Code, § 6380; Pen. Code, § 14231.5.) This form is submitted to the courts by petitioners in many types of protective order proceedings, including 90 proceedings to prevent domestic violence, civil harassment, elder and dependent adult abuse, private postsecondary school violence, gun violence, or abuse or harassment of a child. The information on the form is intended for the use of law enforcement. The form is confidential. Access to the information on the form is limited to authorized court personnel, law enforcement, and other personnel authorized by the California Department of Justice to transmit or receive CLETS information. The form must not be included in the court file. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.51.) 2. Protecting information about a minor in protective order cases: Under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6 and Family Code section 6301.5, a minor or minor’s legal guardian may petition the court to have information regarding the minor kept confidential if the information was obtained in connection with a request for a civil harassment or domestic violence protective order. The information that may be kept confidential includes, but is not limited to, the minor’s name and address, and the circumstances surrounding the request for a protective order with respect to the minor. California Rules of Court, rules 3.1161 and 5.382, provide standards and procedures for courts to follow when handling requests to make minors’ information confidential in civil harassment and domestic violence protective order proceedings, respectively. The minor or the minor’s legal guardian may submit a Request to Keep Minor’s Information Confidential (forms CH-160 and DV-160) at any time during the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.1161(d)(1), 5.382(d)(1).) Using the Order on Request to Keep Minor’s Information Confidential (forms CH-165 and DV-165), a court must expressly find all of the following to grant such a request:  “The minor’s right to privacy overcomes the right of public access to the information”;  “There is a substantial probability that the minor’s interest will be prejudiced if the information is not kept confidential”;  “The order to keep the information confidential is narrowly tailored”; and  “No less restrictive alternative exists to protect the minor’s privacy.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6(v)(2); Fam. Code, § 6301.5(b).) When a confidentiality order has been issued, the requesting party will use the Notice of Order Protecting Information of Minor (forms CH-170 and DV-170) as a cover sheet, serving it with the order and with the documents that contain information the court has ordered to be protected (confidential). The cover sheet will provide notice to the party (often the restrained person) being served with unredacted documents that the documents contain confidential information subject to a confidentiality order. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.1161(e)(2)(D), 5.382(e)(2)(D).) Cover Sheet for Confidential Information (forms CH-175 and DV-175) will be used as a cover sheet for any documents that include confidential information subsequently filed in the 91 protective order proceedings. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.1161(i)(1), 5.382(i)(1).) This form alerts the clerk that the documents contain confidential information so that the court can file the unredacted documents in the court’s confidential files and make a determination as to who would be responsible for redaction of the documents; redacted versions could then be placed in the public files. This cover sheet can also be used in any other civil proceedings to alert the court in that proceeding that a confidentiality order exists protecting the minor’s information. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6(v)(3)(A); Fam. Code, § 6301.5(c)(1).) A court, on its own motion at any time or on the filing of a petition, may grant disclosure of information ordered to be kept confidential to certain individuals or entities as necessary to prevent harassment or if it is in the best interest of the minor. (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6(v)(4); Fam. Code, § 6301.5(d).) The minor’s legal guardian who petitioned to keep the information confidential, the protected party, or a person who received confidential information may disclose confidential information without a court order under specified conditions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6(v)(3)(B); Fam. Code, § 6301.5(c)(2).) A court may impose a sanction of up to $1,000 for disclosure of confidential information made without a court order, after determining whether the person who made the disclosure is reasonably likely to have the ability to pay the sanction, except that the minor who alleged harassment may not be sanctioned. (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6(v)(3)(A); Fam. Code, § 6301.5(c)(1).) Jury Information Records that are confidential 1. Juror questionnaires of those jurors not called for voir dire: The questionnaires of jurors not called to the jury box for voir dire are not open to the public. ( Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 77, 87–88); but cf. Bellas v. Superior Court of Alameda County (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 636, 645, fn. 6 [suggesting a contrary rule].) 2. Sealed juror records in criminal courts: After the jury reaches a verdict in a criminal case, the court’s record of personal juror identifying information (including names, addresses, and telephone numbers) must be sealed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 237(a)(2).) This is often accomplished by replacing juror names with numbers. Indeed, that is how appellate court records contain the relevant information while conforming to the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 237. The defendant or his or her counsel can petition the court for access to this information to aid in developing a motion for a new trial or for any other lawful purpose. (Code Civ. Proc., § 206(g).) Records that may be confidential 1. Records of grand jury proceedings: These records are not open to the public unless an indictment is returned. If an indictment is returned, records of the grand jury proceeding are not open to the public until 10 days after a copy of the indictment has been delivered to the defendant or his or her attorney. (Pen. Code, § 938.1(b); Daily Journal Corp. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1117, 1124–1135.) If there is a “reasonable likelihood” that release of all or part of the transcript would prejudice the accused’s right to a fair and 92 impartial trial, a judge may seal that part of the transcript until the defendant’s trial has been completed. (Pen. Code, § 938.1; see Rosato v. Superior Court (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 190, 206 [trial court had authority and duty, in view of extensive publicity given to the handing down of the indictment of public officials, to order that transcript of grand jury testimony be sealed.) Notwithstanding the confidential status of a record, in civil grand juries, a judge may order disclosure of certain evidentiary materials, as long as information identifying any person who provided information to the grand jury is removed. (Pen. Code, § 929.) Also, after an indictment is returned, the judge may order disclosure of nontestimonial portions of the grand jury proceedings to aid preparation of a motion to dismiss the indictment. ( People v. Superior Court (Mouchaourab) (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 403, 434–436.) 2. Courts’ inherent power to protect jurors: Courts may exercise their discretion to seal juror records where a “compelling interest” exists, such as protecting jurors’ privacy, protecting litigants’ rights, or protecting the public from injury. ( Pantos v. City and County of San Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 258, 262; see also, Code Civ. Proc., § 237; Townsel v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1084, 1091 [a trial court has inherent power to protect juror safety and juror privacy].) Thus any juror information that a judge orders sealed is not open to the public. 3. Confidentiality of requests for permanent medical excuse from jury service: Rule 2.1009 of the California Rules of Court provides a process that a person with a disability may use to request a permanent medical excuse or release from jury service where the person’s condition is unlikely to resolve and, with or without accommodations, including the provision of auxiliary aids or services, the person is not capable of performing jury service. The rule provides that the jury commissioner must keep confidential all information concerning the request for permanent medical excuse, including any accompanying request for disability-related accommodation, unless the applicant waives confidentiality in writing or the law requires disclosure. The applicant’s identity and confidential information may not be disclosed to the public but may be disclosed to court officials and personnel involved in the permanent medical excuse process. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.1009(c)(4).) 10.3.2 Sealed Records Rules 2.550 and 2.551 of the California Rules of Court address orders sealing trial court records. The content and scope of the sealing is specified in the sealing order. The order must direct the sealing of “only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each document or page must be included in the public file.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(e)(1)(B).) “Sealed records must be securely filed and kept separate from the public file in the case. If the sealed records are in electronic form, appropriate access controls must be established to 93 ensure that only authorized persons may access the sealed records.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(f).) There are also specific statutes and rules allowing the sealing of juvenile records. Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 781, and rule 5.830 of the California Rules of Court, for example, a former ward of the court may petition the court to order juvenile records sealed. If the petition is granted, “the court must order the sealing of all records described in section 781 using form JV-590, Order to Seal Juvenile Records–Welfare and Institutions Code Section 781 , or a similar form. The order must apply in the county of the court hearing the petition and in all other counties in which there are juvenile records concerning the petitioner. If the court determines that sealing the records of another court for a petition that has not been transferred is inappropriate, it must inform the petitioner that a petition to seal those records can be filed in the county where the other court is located.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.830(a)(6).) “All records sealed must be destroyed according to section 781(d).” (Cal. Rules of court, rule 5.830(c); see Welf. & Inst. Code, § 781(d) [absent good cause, the court must order the destruction of juvenile court records sealed under that section after a specified period or when the person described in the records reaches a specified age]; see also Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 389, 781.5, 786, 786.5, 793 [authorizing sealing orders for juvenile records].) 10.4 Judicial Administrative Records Judicial administrative records are not “court records,” as defined in the Government Code. (Compare Gov. Code, § 68150(a) [defining “court record”], with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.500(c)(2) [defining “judicial administrative record”].) Judicial administrative records are outside the scope of this manual. (But see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.500 [addressing the public’s right of access to judicial administrative records].) 94 11. Retention, Preservation, and Destruction of Court Records 11.1 Retention, Preservation, and Destruction Practices This section provides guidance for the retention, preservation, and destruction of court case records only. Records managers may systematically destroy records in accordance with statutes and rules enumerated in the “Schedule of Records Retention and Destruction and Special Case Type Characteristics,” found in section 11.4, below. Courts are encouraged to include a records destruction process in their comprehensive records management program. Case records may be classified and segregated in accordance with retention requirements so that like records can be easily identified for purging when retention periods have elapsed. Court records that are being destroyed may be either (1) recycled or (2) shredded and then recycled. All confidential records must be shredded prior to recycling. Because of environmental issues and for consistency with the California Integrated Waste Management Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 40000 et seq.), recycling paper from court case records is highly recommended. Paper to be recycled should be maintained in a secure area until picked up by a recycling vendor. Government Code section 68150(a) states that trial court records “may be created, maintained, and preserved in any form or forms of communication or representation, including paper, optical, electronic, magnetic, micrographic, or photographic media or other technology adopted by the Judicial Council.” As authorized in Government Code section 68152, the clerk of the court may destroy court records pursuant to Government Code section 68153 if specified conditions are met, with the exception of “comprehensive historical and sample court records,” discussed in the next section below, which must be preserved. Notation of the date on which records are destroyed must “be made on the index of cases or on a separate destruction index.” (Gov. Code, § 68153.) The five conditions for the destruction of records under Government Code sections 68152 and 68153 are as follows: 1. The applicable retention period has expired (Gov. Code, § 68152); 2. There is a final disposition of the case (Gov. Code, § 68152; see id ., § 68151(c) [defining “[f]inal disposition of the case”]); 3. The court has given notice of its intent to destroy records (Gov. Code, § 68152; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.856(b), (f) [notice requirements and mandatory forms]); 95 4. There is no request and no order for transfer of the records (Gov. Code, § 68152; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855(c)–(e), (h) [requirements where one or more entity requests possession of the records and mandatory form]); and 5. The presiding judge of the court orders the records to be destroyed (Gov. Code, § 68153; see also, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.856(f)). A court must use the following forms as part of its records destruction process: 1. Notice of Intent to Destroy Superior Court Records; Offer to Transfer Possession (form REC-001(N)) with a form on the reverse titled Request for Transfer or Extension of Time for Retention of Superior Court Records (form REC-001(R)); 2. Notice of Hearing on Request for Transfer or Extension of Time for Retention of Superior Court Records; Court Order; Release and Receipt of Superior Court Records (form REC-002(N)); and 3. Release and Receipt of Superior Court Records (form REC-002(R)). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.856(h).) 11.1.1 Court Records Sampling Program Government Code section 68152 prohibits superior courts from destroying “comprehensive historical and sample superior court records preserved for research under the California Rules of Court.” (See also, Gov. Code, § 68150(i)(1).) To implement the statutory requirement, the Judicial Council adopted rule 10.855 of the California Rules of Court, establishing the superior court records sampling program. The rule expressly does not address records of limited civil, small claims, misdemeanor, or infraction cases. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855(a).) Comprehensive and Significant Records Rule 10.855(c) of the California Rules of Court, directs that each superior court must preserve forever the following “comprehensive and significant records”: 1. “All records filed before 1911”; 2. “If practicable, all records filed after 1910 and before 1950”; 3. “All cases indexes”; and 4. “All noncapital cases in which the California Supreme Court has issued a written opinion.” (See section 11.3, below, for more information.) Sampling Technique Three superior courts, assigned in rotation by the Judicial Council, must preserve a random sample of 25 percent of their court records for a calendar year. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855(f)(1).) In recognition of the considerably greater number of cases filed with the Superior Court of Los Angeles County each year, rule 10.855(f)(1) creates an exception for 96 this court, which must preserve a random sample of 10 percent of its court records for an assigned calendar year. All courts must also preserve all judgment books, minute books, and registers of action if maintained separately from the case files, for the assigned calendar year. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule10.855(f)(2).) The rotation assignment for samples of court records is included in Appendix 2 of this manual. Retroactive Application The Judicial Council amended rule 10.855 effective July 1, 2016, substantially reducing the overall number of records that superior courts must preserve, and the corresponding burden on courts, while still retaining a statistically significant sample of statewide records. The revised sampling program applies retroactively to all superior courts. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855(j).) Because the destruction of court records is discretionary unless otherwise provided by law, all courts may elect to apply the rule retroactively and destroy court records that are not required to be preserved under the new sampling program, but they are not required to do so. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855, Advisory Committee Com. to subd. (j).) Superior courts that destroyed court records under the prior sampling rule may have preserved only 10 percent of their records (formerly known as the “systematic sample”) for the year that they are now assigned to preserve the sample defined in subdivision (f) of rule 10.855. With the exception of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, which is assigned to preserve only 10 percent of its records in the new sampling program, these courts would not be able to meet the requirement in subdivision (f)(1). The Advisory Committee Comment to rule 10.855 clarifies that, so long as these courts continue preserving the 10 percent sample for their assigned year, they will be deemed to have satisfied subdivision (f)(1). (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.855, Advisory Committee Com.) Notice Requirement Under rule 10.856(b) of the California Rules of Court, superior courts are required to give 30 days’ written notice of intent to destroy court records open to public inspection. The notice is sent to entities maintained on the Judicial Council’s master list, which can be located on the Judicial Resources Network, and to others who directly requested notification. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.856(b).) 11.2 Inactive Records Storage By definition and design, an active filing system will lead to a continuous movement of records from active to inactive filing systems or records storage areas. Records are subject to much less activity in an inactive records storage area than in an active filing system, but records are still being added, individual records continue to be accessed 97 periodically, and records may be moved out for destruction or transferred to another location, such as an archive. The purpose of inactive records storage is simply to move inactive or closed case records from prime filing system space to lower-cost space where records may be more densely packed with the understanding that they are accessed with decreasing frequency as they become older. An inactive system may be expanded as the need arises. The records retention and destruction schedule is the primary tool used to manage the inventory of inactive records. It identifies records that can be destroyed and those that must be retained. 11.3 Noncapital Cases in Which the California Supreme Court Issues a Written Opinion Pursuant to rule 10.855(c)(4) of the California Rules of Court, each court must preserve forever the records for all noncapital cases in which the California Supreme Court has issued a written opinion.16 It is the responsibility of every court to check annually and flag the cases that, as a result of Supreme Court review, must be permanently retained in the sampling program. Courts may search Supreme Court case information on the California Courts website. 16 As indicated in section 11.4.1, below, courts also must retain permanently all records in capital cases. (Gov. Code, § 68152(c)(1).) 98 11.4 Schedule of Records Retention and Destruction and Special Case Type Characteristics 11.4.1 Records Retention and Destruction Schedule under Government Code Sections 68152 and 68153 Government Code sections 68152 and 68153 specify the retention periods for most court records.

The record must be transmitted separately from the rest of a clerk's or reporter's transcript, appendix, supporting documents, or other records sent to the reviewing court with a cover sheet that complies with rule 8.40(b) if the record is in paper form or rule 8.74(a)(9) if the record is in electronic form, and that labels the contents as \"CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL.\" If the record is in paper format, it must be placed in a sealed envelope or other appropriate sealed container. (4) If necessary to prevent disclosure of material contained in a conditionally sealed record, any motion or application, any opposition, and any supporting documents must be filed in a redacted version and lodged in a complete unredacted version conditionally under seal. The cover of the redacted version must identify it as \"Public-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record.\" In juvenile cases, the cover of the redacted version must identify it as \"Redacted version-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record.\" The cover of the unredacted version must identify it as \"May Not Be Examined Without Court Order-Contains material from conditionally sealed record.\" Unless the court orders otherwise, any party that had access to the record in the trial court or other proceedings under review must be served with a complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a redacted version. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (5) On receiving a lodged record, the clerk must note the date of receipt on the cover sheet and retain but not file the record. The record must remain conditionally under seal pending determination of the motion or application. (6) The court may order a record filed under seal only if it makes the findings required by rule 2.550(d)-(e). (7) If the court denies the motion or application to seal the record, the lodging party may notify the court that the lodged record is to be filed unsealed. This notification must be received within 10 days of the order denying the motion or application to seal, unless otherwise ordered by the court. On receipt of this notification, the clerk must unseal and file the record. If the lodging party does not notify the court within 10 days of the order, the clerk must (1) return the lodged record to the lodging party if it is in paper form, or (2) permanently delete the lodged record if it is in electronic form. (8) An order sealing the record must direct the sealing of only those documents and pages or, if reasonably practical, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each document or page must be included in the public file. (9) Unless the sealing order provides otherwise, it prohibits the parties from disclosing the contents of any materials that have been sealed in anything that is subsequently publicly filed. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted as subd (e); previously amended effective July 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019; previously amended and relettered as subd (d) effective January 1, 2014.) (e) Challenge to an order denying a motion or application to seal a record Notwithstanding the provisions in (d)(1)-(2), when an appeal or original proceeding challenges an order denying a motion or application to seal a record, the appellant or petitioner must lodge the subject record labeled as conditionally under seal in the reviewing court as provided in (d)(3)-(5), and the reviewing court must maintain the record conditionally under seal during the pendency of the appeal or original proceeding. Once the reviewing court's decision on the appeal or original proceeding becomes final, the clerk must (1) return the lodged record to the lodging party if it is in paper form, or (2) permanently delete the lodged record if it is in electronic form. (Subd (e) adopted effective January 1, 2019.) (f) Unsealing a record in the reviewing court (1) A sealed record must not be unsealed except on order of the reviewing court. (2) Any person or entity may serve and file a motion, application, or petition in the reviewing court to unseal a record. (3) If the reviewing court proposes to order a record unsealed on its own motion, the court must send notice to the parties stating the reason for unsealing the record. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, any party may serve and file an opposition within 10 days after the notice is sent, and any other party may serve and file a response within 5 days after an opposition is filed. (4) If necessary to prevent disclosure of material contained in a sealed record, the motion, application, or petition under (2) and any opposition, response, and supporting documents under (2) or (3) must be filed in both a redacted version and a complete unredacted version. The cover of the redacted version must identify it as \"Public-Redacts material from sealed record.\" In juvenile cases, the cover of the redacted version must identify it as \"Redacted version-Redacts material from sealed record.\" The cover of the unredacted version must identify it as \"May Not Be Examined Without Court Order-Contains material from sealed record.\" Unless the court orders otherwise, any party that had access to the sealed record in the trial court or other proceedings under review must be served with a complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a redacted version. If a party's attorney but not the party had access to the record in the trial court or other proceedings under review, only the party's attorney may be served with the complete, unredacted version. (5) In determining whether to unseal a record, the court must consider the matters addressed in rule 2.550(c)-(e). (6) The order unsealing a record must state whether the record is unsealed entirely or in part. If the order unseals only part of the record or unseals the record only as to certain persons, the order must specify the particular records that are unsealed, the particular persons who may have access to the record, or both. (7) If, in addition to the record that is the subject of the sealing order, a court has previously ordered the sealing order itself, the register of actions, or any other court records relating to the case to be sealed, the unsealing order must state whether these additional records are unsealed. (Subd (f) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2019; adopted as subd (f); previously amended effective January 1, 2004, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2016; previously amended and relettered as subd (e) effective January 1, 2014.) (g) Disclosure of nonpublic material in public filings prohibited (1) Nothing filed publicly in the reviewing court-including any application, brief, petition, or memorandum-may disclose material contained in a record that is sealed, lodged conditionally under seal, or otherwise subject to a pending motion to file under seal. (2) If it is necessary to disclose material contained in a sealed record in a filing in the reviewing court, two versions must be filed: (A) A public redacted version. The cover of this version must identify it as \"Public-Redacts material from sealed record.\" In juvenile cases, the cover of the redacted version must identify it as \"Redacted Version-Redacts material from sealed record.\" (B) An unredacted version. If this version is in paper format, it must be placed in a sealed envelope or other appropriate sealed container. The cover of this version, and if applicable the envelope or other container, must identify it as \"May Not Be Examined Without Court Order-Contains material from sealed record.\" Sealed material disclosed in this version must be identified as such in the filing and accompanied by a citation to the court order sealing that material. (C) Unless the court orders otherwise, any party who had access to the sealed record in the trial court or other proceedings under review must be served with both the unredacted version of all papers as well as the redacted version. Other parties must be served with only the public redacted version. If a party's attorney but not the party had access to the record in the trial court or other proceedings under review, only the party's attorney may be served with the unredacted version. (3) If it is necessary to disclose material contained in a conditionally sealed record in a filing in the reviewing court: (A) A public redacted version must be filed. The cover of this version must identify it as \"Public-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record.\" In juvenile cases, the cover of the redacted version must identify it as \"Redacted version-Redacts material from conditionally sealed record.\" (B) An unredacted version must be lodged. The filing must be transmitted in a secure manner that preserves the confidentiality of the filing being lodged. If this version is in paper format, it must be placed in a sealed envelope or other appropriate sealed container. The cover of this version, and if applicable the envelope or other container, must identify it as \"May Not Be Examined Without Court Order-Contains material from conditionally sealed record.\" Conditionally sealed material disclosed in this version must be identified as such in the filing. (C) Unless the court orders otherwise, any party who had access to the conditionally sealed record in the trial court or other proceedings under review must be served with both the unredacted version of all papers as well as the redacted version. Other parties must be served with only the public redacted version. (D) If the court denies the motion or application to seal the record, the party who filed the motion or application may notify the court that the unredacted version lodged under (B) is to be filed unsealed. This notification must be received within 10 days of the order denying the motion or application to seal, unless otherwise ordered by the court. On receipt of this notification, the clerk must unseal and file the lodged unredacted version. If the party who filed the motion or application does not notify the court within 10 days of the order, the clerk must (1) return the lodged unredacted version to the lodging party if it is in paper form, or (2) permanently delete the lodged unredacted version if it is in electronic form. (Subd (g) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2019; adopted as subd (g); previously amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended and relettered as subd (f) effective January 1, 2014.)

Advisory Committee Comment This rule and rules 2.550-2.551 for the trial courts provide a standard and procedures for courts to use when a request is made to seal a record. The standard is based on NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. The sealed records rules apply to civil and criminal cases. They recognize the First Amendment right of access to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this rule, motions in a reviewing court relating to the sealing or unsealing of a record must follow rule 8.54. Subdivision (e). This subdivision is not intended to expand the availability of existing appellate review for any person aggrieved by a court's denial of a motion or application to seal a record.",

(Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2019; previously amended effective January 1, 2016.) Rule 8.47 amended effective January 1, 2019; adopted effective January 1, 2014; previously amended effective January 1, 2016. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivisions (a) and (c). Note that there are many laws that address the confidentiality of various records. These laws differ from each other in a variety of respects, including what information is closed to inspection, from whom it is closed, under what circumstances it is closed, and what procedures apply to closing or opening it to inspection. It is very important to determine if any such law applies with respect to a particular record because this rule applies only to confidential records as defined in rule 8.45, and the procedures in this rule apply only \"unless otherwise provided by law.\" Thus, where other laws establish specific requirements that differ from the requirements in this rule, those specific requirements supersede the requirements in this rule. For example, although Penal Code section 1203.05 limits who may inspect or copy probation reports, much of the material contained in such reports-such as the factual summary of the offense(s); the evaluations, analyses, calculations, and recommendations of the probation officer; and other nonpersonal information-is not considered confidential under that statute and is routinely discussed in openly filed appellate briefs (see People v. Connor (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 669, 695-696). In addition, this rule does not alter any existing authority for a court to open a confidential record to inspection by the public or another party to a proceeding. Subdivision (c)(1). The reference in this provision to records that a party may choose be kept confidential in reviewing court proceedings is intended to encompass situations in which a record may be subject to a privilege that a party may choose to maintain or choose to waive. Subdivision (c)(2). Note that when a record has been sealed by court order, rule 8.46(g)(2) requires a party to file redacted (public) and unredacted (sealed) versions of any filing that discloses material from the sealed record; it does not require the party to make a motion or application for permission to do so. By contrast, this rule requires court permission before redacted (public) and unredacted (sealed) filings may be made to prevent disclosure of material from confidential records.",

(d) Remote electronic access allowed in extraordinary cases CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 Notwithstanding (c)(2), the presiding justice of the court, or a justice assigned by the presiding justice, may exercise discretion, subject to (d)(1), to permit remote electronic access by the public to all or a portion of the public court records in an individual case if (1) the number of requests for access to documents in the case is extraordinarily high and (2) responding to those requests would significantly burden the operations of the court. An individualized determination must be made in each case in which such remote electronic access is provided. (1) In exercising discretion under (d), the justice should consider the relevant factors, such as: (A) The privacy interests of parties, victims, witnesses, and court personnel, and the ability of the court to redact sensitive personal information; (B) The benefits to and burdens on the parties in allowing remote electronic access; and (C) The burdens on the court in responding to an extraordinarily high number of requests for access to documents. (2) The following information must be redacted from records to which the court allows remote access under (d): driver's license numbers; dates of birth; social security numbers; Criminal Identification and Information and National Crime Information numbers; addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of parties, victims, witnesses, and court personnel; medical or psychiatric information; financial information; account numbers; and other personal identifying information. The court may order any party who files a document containing such information to provide the court with both an original unredacted version of the document for filing in the court file and a redacted version of the document for remote electronic access. No juror names or other juror identifying information may be provided by remote electronic access. Subdivision (d)(2) does not apply to any document in the original court file; it applies only to documents that are made available by remote electronic access. (3) Five days' notice must be provided to the parties and the public before the court makes a determination to provide remote electronic access under this rule. Notice to the public may be accomplished by posting notice on the court's website. Any person may file comments with the court for consideration, but no hearing is required. (4) The court's order permitting remote electronic access must specify which court records will be available by remote electronic access and what categories of information are to be redacted. The court is not required to make findings of fact. The court's order must be posted on the court's website and a copy sent to the Judicial Council. (e) Access only on a case-by-case basis With the exception of the records covered by (b)(1), electronic access to an electronic record may be granted only when the record is identified by the number of the case, the caption of the case, the name of a party, the name of the attorney, or the date of oral argument, and only on a case-by-case basis. (f) Bulk distribution Bulk distribution may be provided only of the records covered by (b)(1). (g) Records that become inaccessible If an electronic record to which electronic access has been provided is made inaccessible to the public by court order or by operation of law, the court is not required to take action with respect to any copy of the record that was made by a member of the public before the record became inaccessible. Rule 8.83 adopted effective January 1, 2016. Advisory Committee Comment The rule allows a level of access by the public to all electronic records that is at least equivalent to the access that is available for paper records and, for some types of records, is much greater. At the same time, it seeks to protect legitimate privacy concerns. Subdivision (b). Courts should encourage availability of electronic access to court records at public off-site locations. Subdivision (c). This subdivision excludes certain records (those other than the register, calendar, opinions, and certain Supreme Court records) in specified types of cases (notably criminal, juvenile, and family court matters) from remote electronic access. The committees recognized that while these case records are public records and should remain available at the courthouse, either in paper or electronic form, they often contain sensitive personal information. The court should not publish that information over the Internet. However, the committees also recognized that the use of the Internet may be appropriate in certain individual cases of extraordinary public interest where information regarding a case will be widely disseminated through the media. In such cases, posting of selected nonconfidential court records, redacted where necessary to protect the privacy of the participants, may provide more timely and accurate information regarding the court proceedings, and may relieve substantial burdens on court staff in responding to individual requests for documents and information. Thus, under subdivision (d), if the presiding justice makes individualized determinations in a specific case, certain records in individual cases may be made available over the Internet. Subdivision (d). Courts must send a copy of the order permitting remote electronic access in extraordinary cases to: Legal Services, Judicial Council of California, 455 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94102-3688. Subdivisions (e) and (f). These subdivisions limit electronic access to records (other than the register, calendars, opinions, and certain Supreme Court records) to a case-by-case basis and prohibit bulk distribution of those records. These limitations are based on the qualitative difference between obtaining information from a specific case file and obtaining bulk information that may be manipulated to compile personal information culled from any document, paper, or exhibit filed in a lawsuit. This type of aggregate information may be exploited for commercial or other purposes unrelated to the operations of the courts, at the expense of privacy rights of individuals.",

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) states the maximum permissible length of a brief produced on a computer in terms of word count rather than page count. This provision tracks a provision in rule 8.204(c) governing Court of Appeal briefs and is explained in the comment to that provision. The word count assumes a brief using one-and-one-half spaced lines of text, as permitted by rule 8.204(b)(5). Subdivision (b)(3) specifies certain items that are not counted toward the maximum brief length. Signature blocks as referenced in this provision, include not only the signatures, but also the printed names, titles, and affiliations of any attorneys filing or joining in the brief, which may accompany the signature. The maximum permissible length of briefs in death penalty appeals is prescribed in rule 8.630.",

See rule 8.25(c). Subdivisions (c) and (d). Subdivisions (c) and (d) state in terms of word count rather than page count the maximum permissible lengths of Supreme Court briefs produced on a computer.

Subdivision (c)(3) specifies certain items that are not counted toward the maximum brief length. The signature block referenced in this provision includes not only the signatures, but also the printed names, titles, and affiliations of any attorneys filing or joining in the brief, which may accompany the signature.",

Rule 8.487 amended effective January 1, 2017; adopted effective January 1, 2009; previously amended effective January 1, 2014. Advisory Committee Comment A party other than the petitioner who files a preliminary opposition under (a) or a return or opposition under (b) may be required to pay a filing fee under Government Code section 68926 if the preliminary opposition, return, or opposition is the first document filed in the writ proceeding in the reviewing court by that party. See rule 8.25(c). Subdivision (a). Consistent with practice, rule 8.487 draws a distinction between a \"preliminary opposition,\" which the respondent or a real party in interest may file before the court takes any action on the petition ((a)(1)), and a more formal \"opposition,\" which the respondent or a real party in interest may file if the court notifies the parties that it is considering issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance ((b)(1)). Subdivision (a)(1) allows the respondent or any real party in interest to serve and file a preliminary opposition within 10 days after the petition is filed. The reviewing court retains the power to act in any case without obtaining preliminary opposition ((a)(4)). Subdivision (a)(3) allows a petitioner to serve and file a reply within 10 days after a preliminary opposition is filed. To permit prompt action in urgent cases, however, the provision recognizes that the reviewing court may act on the petition without waiting for a reply. Subdivision (a)(4) recognizes that the reviewing court may \"grant or deny a request for temporary stay\" without requesting preliminary opposition or waiting for a reply. The several references in rule 8.487 to the power of the court to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance after notifying the parties that it is considering doing so ((a)-(b)) implement the rule of Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. (1984) 36 Cal.3d 171. Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(2) requires that the return or opposition be served and filed within 30 days after the court issues the alternative writ or order to show cause or notifies the parties that it is considering issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance. To permit prompt action in urgent cases, however, the provision recognizes that the reviewing court may order otherwise. Subdivision (b)(3) formalizes the common practice of permitting petitioners to file replies to returns and specifies that such a reply must be served and filed within 15 days after the return is filed. To permit prompt action in urgent cases, however, the provision recognizes that the reviewing court may order otherwise. Subdivision (c). Examples of confidential records include records of the family conciliation court (Fam. Code, § 1818 (b)) and fee waiver applications (Gov. Code, § 68633(f)). Subdivisions (d) and (e). These provisions do not alter the court's authority to request or permit the filing of amicus briefs or amicus letters in writ proceedings in circumstances not covered by these subdivisions, such as before the court has determined whether to issue an alternative writ or order to show cause or when it notifies the parties that it is considering issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance.",

The court and its staff must employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important civic responsibility.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Principles  The following principles govern the granting of excuses from jury service by the jury commissioner on grounds of undue hardship under Code of Civil Procedure section 204: (1) No class or category of persons may be automatically excluded from jury duty except as provided by law. (2) A statutory exemption from jury service must be granted only when the eligible person claims it. (3) Deferring jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror for a temporary or marginal hardship. (4) Inconvenience to a prospective juror or an employer is not an adequate reason to be excused from jury duty, although it may be considered a ground for deferral.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Requests to be excused from jury service  All requests to be excused from jury service that are granted for undue hardship must be put in writing by the prospective juror, reduced to writing, or placed on the court's record. The prospective juror must support the request with facts specifying the hardship and a statement why the circumstances constituting the undue hardship cannot be avoided by deferring the prospective juror's service.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Reasons for excusing a juror because of undue hardship  An excuse on the ground of undue hardship may be granted for any of the following reasons: (1) The prospective juror has no reasonably available means of public or private transportation to the court. (2) The prospective juror must travel an excessive distance.

    "content": "Rule 2.1008. Excuses from jury service (a) Duty of citizenship Jury service, unless excused by law, is a responsibility of citizenship. The court and its staff must employ all necessary and appropriate means to ensure that citizens fulfill this important civic responsibility. (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (b) Principles The following principles govern the granting of excuses from jury service by the jury commissioner on grounds of undue hardship under Code of Civil Procedure section 204: (1) No class or category of persons may be automatically excluded from jury duty except as provided by law. (2) A statutory exemption from jury service must be granted only when the eligible person claims it. (3) Deferring jury service is preferred to excusing a prospective juror for a temporary or marginal hardship. (4) Inconvenience to a prospective juror or an employer is not an adequate reason to be excused from jury duty, although it may be considered a ground for deferral. (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (c) Requests to be excused from jury service All requests to be excused from jury service that are granted for undue hardship must be put in writing by the prospective juror, reduced to writing, or placed on the court's record. The prospective juror must support the request with facts specifying the hardship and a statement why the circumstances constituting the undue hardship cannot be avoided by deferring the prospective juror's service. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (d) Reasons for excusing a juror because of undue hardship An excuse on the ground of undue hardship may be granted for any of the following reasons: (1) The prospective juror has no reasonably available means of public or private transportation to the court. (2) The prospective juror must travel an excessive distance. Unless otherwise established by statute or local rule, an excessive distance is reasonable travel time that exceeds one-and-one-half hours from the prospective juror's home to the court. (3) The prospective juror will bear an extreme financial burden. In determining whether to excuse the prospective juror for this reason, consideration must be given to: (A) The sources of the prospective juror's household income; (B) The availability and extent of income reimbursement; (C) The expected length of service; and (D) Whether service can reasonably be expected to compromise the prospective juror's ability to support himself or herself or his or her dependents, or so disrupt the economic stability of any individual as to be against the interests of justice. (4) The prospective juror will bear an undue risk of material injury to or destruction of the prospective juror's property or property entrusted to the prospective juror, and it is not feasible to make alternative arrangements to alleviate the risk. In determining whether to excuse the prospective juror for this reason, consideration must be given to: (A) The nature of the property; CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (B) The source and duration of the risk; (C) The probability that the risk will be realized; (D) The reason alternative arrangements to protect the property cannot be made; and (E) Whether material injury to or destruction of the property will so disrupt the economic stability of any individual as to be against the interests of justice. (5) The prospective juror has a physical or mental disability or impairment, not affecting that person's competence to act as a juror, that would expose the potential juror to undue risk of mental or physical harm. In any individual case, unless the person is aged 70 years or older, the prospective juror may be required to furnish verification or a method of verification of the disability or impairment, its probable duration, and the particular reasons for the person's inability to serve as a juror. (6) The prospective juror's services are immediately needed for the protection of the public health and safety, and it is not feasible to make alternative arrangements to relieve the person of those responsibilities during the period of service as a juror without substantially reducing essential public services. (7) The prospective juror has a personal obligation to provide actual and necessary care to another, including sick, aged, or infirm dependents, or a child who requires the prospective juror's personal care and attention, and no comparable substitute care is either available or practical without imposing an undue economic hardship on the prospective juror or person cared for. If the request to be excused is based on care provided to a sick, disabled, or infirm person, the prospective juror may be required to furnish verification or a method of verification that the person being cared for is in need of regular and personal care. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (e) Excuse based on previous jury service A prospective juror who has served on a grand or trial jury or was summoned and appeared for jury service in any state or federal court during the previous 12 months must be excused from service on request. The jury commissioner, in his or her discretion, may establish a longer period of repose. (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007.)

As used in this rule, \"calendar preference\" means an expedited appeal schedule, which may include expedited briefing and preference in setting the date of oral argument.  Rule 8.240 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; repealed and adopted as rule 19 effective January 1, 2003.  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 8.240 requires a party claiming preference to file a motion for preference in the reviewing court. The motion requirement relieves the reviewing court of the burden of searching the record to determine if preference should be ordered. The requirement is not intended to bar the court from ordering preference without a motion when the ground is apparent on the face of the appeal, e.g., in appeals from judgments of dependency (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 395). The rule is broad in scope: it includes motions for preference on the grounds (1) that a statute provides for preference in the reviewing court (e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 44 [probate proceedings, contested elections, libel by public official), 45 [judgment freeing minor from parental custody]); (2) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference when a statute provides for trial preference (e.g., id., §§ 35 [certain election matters], 36 [party over 70 and in poor health; party with terminal illness; minor in wrongful death action]; see Warren v. Schecter (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1198-1199); and (3) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference on a nonstatutory ground (e.g., economic hardship). Because valid grounds for preference could arise after the filing of the reply brief, e.g., a diagnosis of terminal illness, the rule requires the motion to be filed \"promptly,\" i.e., as soon as the ground for preference arises.

Rule 8.240 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; repealed and adopted as rule 19 effective January 1, 2003. Advisory Committee Comment Rule 8.240 requires a party claiming preference to file a motion for preference in the reviewing court. The motion requirement relieves the reviewing court of the burden of searching the record to determine if preference should be ordered. The requirement is not intended to bar the court from ordering preference without a motion when the ground is apparent on the face of the appeal, e.g., in appeals from judgments of dependency (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 395). The rule is broad in scope: it includes motions for preference on the grounds (1) that a statute provides for preference in the reviewing court (e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 44 [probate proceedings, contested elections, libel by public official), 45 [judgment freeing minor from parental custody]); (2) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference when a statute provides for trial preference (e.g., id., §§ 35 [certain election matters], 36 [party over 70 and in poor health; party with terminal illness; minor in wrongful death action]; see Warren v. Schecter (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1198-1199); and (3) that the reviewing court should exercise its discretion to grant preference on a nonstatutory ground (e.g., economic hardship). Because valid grounds for preference could arise after the filing of the reply brief, e.g., a diagnosis of terminal illness, the rule requires the motion to be filed \"promptly,\" i.e., as soon as the ground for preference arises.

(h) Preparing the record When the notice of intent is filed, the superior court clerk must: (1) Immediately notify each court reporter, in a manner providing immediate notice, to prepare a reporter's transcript of the oral proceedings at each session of the hearing that resulted in the order under review and deliver the transcript to the clerk within 12 calendar days after the notice of intent is filed; and (2) Within 20 days after the notice of intent is filed, prepare a clerk's transcript that includes the notice of intent, proof of service, and all items listed in rule 8.407(a). (Subd (h) amended effective January 1, 2021; adopted as subd (g); previously amended effective January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2010; amended and relettered effective January 1, 2013.)

(j) Reviewing court clerk's duties (1) The reviewing court clerk must immediately lodge the notice of intent. When the notice is lodged, the reviewing court has jurisdiction of the writ proceedings. (2) When the record is filed in the reviewing court, that court's clerk must immediately notify the parties, stating the date on which the 10-day period for filing the writ petition under rule 8.452(c)(1) will expire.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (d). The case law generally recognizes that the reviewing courts may grant extensions of time under these rules for exceptional good cause. (See, e.g., Jonathan M. v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1826, and In re Cathina W. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 716 [recognizing that a late notice of intent may be filed on a showing of exceptional circumstances not under the petitioner's control].) It may constitute exceptional good cause for an extension of the time to file a notice of intent if a premature notice of intent is returned to a party shortly before the issuance of an order setting a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26. Subdivision (e)(4). See rule 8.25(b)(5) for provisions concerning the timeliness of documents mailed by inmates or patients from custodial institutions. Subdivision (f)(1). A party who prematurely attempts to file a notice of intent to file a writ petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26 is not precluded from later filing such a notice after the issuance of an order setting a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26. Subdivision (i). Under rule 8.71(c), the superior court clerk may send the record to the reviewing court in electronic form.",

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) states the maximum permissible lengths of briefs produced on a computer in terms of word count rather than page count. This provision tracks a provision in rule 8.204(c) governing Court of Appeal briefs and is explained in the comment to that provision. Subdivision (b)(3) specifies certain items that are not counted toward the maximum brief length. Signature blocks, as referenced in this provision, include not only the signatures, but also the printed names, titles, and affiliations of any attorneys filing or joining in the brief, which may accompany the signature. Subdivision (b)(4) provides the maximum length of a brief, with attachments, if the party uses a form brief approved for use by the Judicial Council. The Judicial Council has approved the following optional form briefs that parties may use in limited civil appeals where there is no cross-appeal: Appellant’s Opening Brief—Limited Civil Case (form APP-200), Respondent’s Brief—Limited Civil Case (form APP-201), and Appellant’s Reply Brief—Limited Civil Case (form APP-202).",

The two recorders must simultaneously record the same audio and video signals, as selected by the audio-video mixer. (D) A computer-controlled audio-video mixer and switching system that: (i) Automatically selects for the VCRs the signal from the video camera that is associated with the active microphone; and (ii) Compares microphone active signal to ambient noise signal so that microphones are recorded only when a person is speaking, and so that only the microphone nearest a speaker is active, thus minimizing recording of ambient noise. (E) A sound system that serves both as a sound reinforcement system while recording is in progress, and as a playback amplification system, integrated with other components to minimize feedback. (F) A time-date generator that is active and records at all times the system is recording. (G) A color monitor. (H) Appropriate cables, distribution amplifiers, switches, and the like. (I) The system must produce: (i) A signal visible to the judge, the in-court clerk, and counsel indicating that the system is recording; (ii) An audible signal at end-of-tape or if the tape jams while the controls are set to record; and (iii) Blanking of the judge's bench monitor when the system is not actually recording. (2) Recommended features The system should normally include: (A) A chambers camera and microphone or microphones that, when in use, will override any signals originating in the courtroom, and that will be inactivated when not in use. (B) Two additional videocassette recorders that will produce tapes with the same video and audio as the main two, but may have fewer channels of sound, for the use of parties in cases recorded. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (d) Substantial compliance A sound or video and sound system that substantially conforms to these specifications is approved if the deviation does not significantly impair a major function of the system.

Electronic recordings presented or offered into evidence (a) Electronic recordings of deposition or other prior testimony (1) Before a party may present or offer into evidence an electronic sound or sound-and-video recording of deposition or other prior testimony, the party must lodge a transcript of the deposition or prior testimony with the court. At the time the recording is played, the party must identify on the record the page and line numbers where the testimony presented or offered appears in the transcript. (2) Except as provided in (3), at the time the presentation of evidence closes or within five days after the recording in (1) is presented or offered into evidence, whichever is later, the party presenting or offering the recording into evidence must serve and file a copy of the transcript cover showing the witness name and a copy of the pages of the transcript where the testimony presented or offered appears. The transcript pages must be marked to identify the testimony that was presented or offered into evidence. (3) If the court reporter takes down the content of all portions of the recording in (1) that were presented or offered into evidence, the party offering or presenting the recording is not required to provide a transcript of that recording under (2). (Subd (a) adopted effective July 1, 2011.) (b) Other electronic recordings (1) Except as provided in (2) and (3), before a party may present or offer into evidence any electronic sound or sound-and- video recording not covered under (a), the party must provide to the court and to opposing parties a transcript of the electronic recording and provide opposing parties with a duplicate of the electronic recording, as defined in Evidence Code section 260. The transcript may be prepared by the party presenting or offering the recording into evidence; a certified transcript is not required. (2) For good cause, the trial judge may permit the party to provide the transcript or the duplicate recording at the time the presentation of evidence closes or within five days after the recording is presented or offered into evidence, whichever is later. (3) No transcript is required to be provided under (1): (A) In proceedings that are uncontested or in which the responding party does not appear, unless otherwise ordered by the trial judge; (B) If the parties stipulate in writing or on the record that the sound portion of a sound-and-video recording does not contain any words that are relevant to the issues in the case; or (C) If, for good cause, the trial judge orders that a transcript is not required. (Subd (b) amended and relettered effective July 1, 2011; adopted as part of unlettered subd effective July 1, 1988; amended and lettered as subd (a) effective January 1, 2003.) (c) Clerk's duties An electronic recording provided to the court under this rule must be marked for identification. A transcript provided under (a)(2) or (b)(1) must be filed by the clerk. (Subd (c) amended and relettered effective July 1, 2011; adopted as part of unlettered subd effective July 1, 1988; amended and lettered as subd (a) effective January 1, 2003.) (d) Reporting by court reporter Unless otherwise ordered by the trial judge, the court reporter need not take down the content of an electronic recording that is presented or offered into evidence. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (Subd (d) amended and relettered effective July 1, 2011; adopted as part of unlettered subd. effective July 1, 1988; amended and lettered as subd. (b) effective January 1, 2003.) Rule 2.1040 amended effective July 1, 2011; adopted as rule 203.5 effective July 1, 1988; previously amended effective January 1, 1997; previously amended and renumbered as rule 243.9 effective January 1, 2003, and as rule 2.1040 effective January 1, 2007. Advisory Committee Comment This rule is designed to ensure that, in the event of an appeal, there is an appropriate record of any electronic sound or sound-and- video recording that was presented or offered into evidence in the trial court. The rules on felony, misdemeanor, and infraction appeals require that any transcript provided by a party under this rule be included in the clerk's transcript on appeal (see rules 8.320, 8.861, and 8.912). In civil appeals, the parties may designate such a transcript for inclusion in the clerk's transcript (see rules 8.122(b) and 8.832(a)). The transcripts required under this rule may also assist the court or jurors during the trial court proceedings. For this purpose, it may be helpful for the trial court to request that the party offering an electronic recording provide additional copies of such transcripts for jurors to follow while the recording is played. Subdivision (a ). Note that, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.510(g), if the testimony at a deposition is recorded both stenographically and by audio or video technology, the stenographic transcript is the official record of that testimony for the purpose of the trial and any subsequent hearing or appeal. Subdivision (a)(2 ). The party offering or presenting the electronic recording may serve and file a copy of the cover and of the relevant pages of the deposition or other transcript; a new transcript need not be prepared. Subdivision (b ). Note that, with the exception of recordings covered by Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.510(g), the recording itself, not the transcript, is the evidence that was offered or presented (see People v. Sims (1993) 5 Cal.4th 405, 448). Sometimes, a party may present or offer into evidence only a portion of a longer electronic recording. In such circumstances, the transcript provided to the court and opposing parties should contain only a transcription of those portions of the electronic recording that are actually presented or offered into evidence. If a party believes that a transcript provided under this subdivision is inaccurate, the party can raise an objection in the trial court. Subdivision (b)(3)(C ). Good cause to waive the requirement for a transcript may include such factors as (1) the party presenting or offering the electronic recording into evidence lacks the capacity to prepare a transcript or (2) the electronic recording is of such poor quality that preparing a useful transcript is not feasible. Subdivision (c). The requirement to file a transcript provided to the court under (a)(2) or (b)(1) is intended to ensure that the transcript is available for inclusion in a clerk's transcript in the event of an appeal. Subdivision (d ). In some circumstances it may be helpful to have the court reporter take down the content of an electronic recording. For example, when short portions of a sound or sound-and-video recording of deposition or other testimony are played to impeach statements made by a witness on the stand, the best way to create a useful record of the proceedings may be for the court reporter to take down the portions of recorded testimony that are interspersed with the live testimony.",

Rule 3.869 adopted effective July 1, 2009, effective date extended to January 1, 2010. Advisory Committee Comment Judicial Council staff have developed model local rules that satisfy the requirements of this rule. These model local rules were developed with input from judicial officers, court administrators, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program administrators, CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 court-program mediators, and public commentators and are designed so that they can be readily adapted to the circumstances of individual courts and specific complaints. Courts are encouraged to adopt rules that follow the model rules, to the extent feasible. Courts can obtain copies of these model rules from the Judicial Council's civil ADR program staff. Subdivision (a). Coordination of inquiries and complaints by a person knowledgeable about mediation is important to help ensure that the requirements of this article are followed and that mediation confidentiality is preserved. Subdivision (c). Courts are encouraged to resolve inquiries and complaints about mediators using the simplest, least formal procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances, provided that they meet the requirements stated in this article. Most complaints can be appropriately resolved during the preliminary review stage of the complaint process, through informal discussions between or among the complaint coordinator, the complainant, and the mediator. Although complaint coordinators are not required to communicate with the mediator during the preliminary review, they are encouraged to consider doing so. For example, some complaints may arise from a misunderstanding of the mediator's role or from behavior that would not violate the standards of conduct. These types of complaints might appropriately be addressed by providing the complainant with additional information or by informing the mediator that certain behavior was upsetting to a mediation participant. The circumstances under which a complaint coordinator might informally resolve or close a complaint include, for example, when (1) the complaint is withdrawn; (2) no violation of the rules of conduct appears to have occurred; (3) the alleged violation of the rules of conduct is very minor and the mediator has provided an acceptable explanation or response; and (4) the complainant, the mediator, and the complaint coordinator have agreed on a resolution. In determining whether to close a complaint, the complaint coordinator might also consider whether there are or have been other complaints about the mediator. Subdivision (d). At the investigation and recommendation stage, all courts are encouraged to consider using a complaint committee comprised of members with a variety of backgrounds, including at least one person with experience as a mediator, to investigate and make recommendations concerning those rare complaints that are not resolved during the preliminary review. Courts are also encouraged to have a judicial officer who is knowledgeable about mediation, or a committee that includes another person who is knowledgeable about mediation, make the final decision on complaints that are not resolved through the preliminary review.",

(b) Case management  The case management rules in chapter 3 of division 7 of these rules, starting at rule 3.720, are applicable to all cases with mandatory expedited jury trials, except to the extent the rules have been modified by local court rules applicable to limited civil cases.  (c) Opting out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures  (1) Parties seeking to opt out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures on grounds stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 630.20(b) must file a   Request to Opt Out of Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures   (form EJT-003). (2) Except on a showing of good cause, the request to opt out must be served and filed at least 45 days before the date first set for trial or, in cases in which the date first set for trial occurred before July 1, 2016, 45 days before the first trial date after July 1, 2016. (3) Except on a showing of good cause, any objection to the request must be served and filed within 15 days after the date of service of the request, on an   Objection to Request to Opt Out of Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial Procedures   (form EJT- 004). (4) If the grounds on which a party or parties have opted out of mandatory expedited jury trial procedures no longer apply to a case, the parties must promptly inform the court, and the case may be tried as a mandatory expedited jury trial.  (Subd (c) amended effective September 1, 2017.)  (d) Agreements regarding pretrial and trial procedures  Parties are encouraged to agree to procedures or limitations on pretrial procedures and on presentation of information at trial that could streamline the case, including but not limited to those items described in rule 3.1547(b).

Rule 3.1546 amended effective September 1, 2017; adopted effective July 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  Because Code of Civil Procedure section 630.20, which becomes operative July 1, 2016, applies to cases already on file and possibly already set for trial, as well as cases filed after the statutory provisions go into effect, the deadlines in rule 3.1546(c) for opt outs and objections may be problematic as applied to cases set for trial within the first couple of months after the rule goes into effect. It is expected that the good cause provisions within the rules regarding deadlines, along with judicious use of continuances as appropriate, will be liberally used to permit courts to manage those cases fairly, appropriately, and efficiently.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b).   Subdivision (b)(2)(A) recognizes the general rule that the denial of a petition for review of a Court of Appeal decision is final on filing. Subdivision (b)(2)(B)-(D) recognizes several additional types of Supreme Court decisions that are final on filing. Thus (b)(2)(B) recognizes that a dismissal, a transfer, and a retransfer under (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of rule 8.528 are decisions final on filing. A remand under rule 8.528(c) is not a decision final on filing because it is not a separately filed order; rather, as part of its appellate judgment at the end of its opinion in such cases the Supreme Court simply orders the cause remanded to the Court of Appeal for disposition of the remaining issues in the appeal. Subdivision (b)(2)(C) recognizes that an order denying a petition for a writ within the court's original jurisdiction without issuance of an alternative writ or order to show cause is final on filing. The provision reflects the settled Supreme Court practice, since at least 1989, of declining to file petitions for rehearing in such matters. (See, e.g.,   In re Hayes   (S004421) Minutes, Cal. Supreme Ct., July 28, 1989 [\"The motion to vacate this court's order of May 18, 1989 [denying a petition for habeas corpus without opinion] is denied. Because the California Rules of Court do not authorize the filing of a petition for rehearing of such an order, the alternate request to consider the matter as a petition for rehearing is denied.\"].)

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) states the maximum permissible lengths of briefs produced on a computer in terms of word count rather than page count. This provision tracks a provision in rule 8.204(c) governing Court of Appeal briefs and is explained in the comment to that provision. Each word count assumes a brief using one-and-one-half spaced lines of text, as permitted by rule 8.204(b)(5). Subdivision (b)(4) specifies certain items that are not counted toward the maximum brief length. Signature blocks, as referenced in this provision includes not only the signatures, but also the printed names, titles, and affiliations of any attorneys filing or joining in the brief, which may accompany the signature. Subdivision (g). Subdivision (g)(1) is a cross-reference to Policy 4 of the Supreme Court Policies Regarding Cases Arising From Judgments of Death.",

(e) Orders on request for confidentiality (1) Rulings The court may grant the entire request, deny the entire request, or partially grant the request for confidentiality. (2) Order granting request for confidentiality (A) em] Applicability An order made under Family Code section 6301.5 applies in this case and in any other civil case to all registers of actions, indexes, court calendars, pleadings, discovery documents, and other documents filed or served in the action, and at hearings, trial, and other court proceedings that are open to the public. (B) Minor's name If the court grants a request for confidentiality of the minor's name and: (i) If the minor is a party to the action, the court must use the initials of the minor, or other initials at the discretion of the court. In addition, the court must use only initials to identify both parties to the action if using the other party's name would likely reveal the identity of the minor. (ii) If the minor is not a party to the action, the court must not include any information that would likely reveal the identity of the minor, including whether the minor lives with the person making the request for confidentiality. (C) Circumstances surrounding protective order (statements related to minor) If the court grants a request for confidentiality, the order must specifically identify the information about the minor in Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-100) and any other applicable document that must be kept confidential. Information about the minor ordered confidential by the court must not be made available to the public. (D) Service and copies The other party, or both parties if the person making the request for confidentiality is not a party to the action, must be served with a copy of the Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential (form DV-160), Order on Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential (form DV-165), and Notice of Order Protecting Information of Minor (form DV-170), redacted if required under (f)(4). The protected person and the person requesting confidentiality (if not the protected person) must be provided up to three copies of redacted and unredacted copies of any request or order form. (3) Order denying request for confidentiality (A) The order denying confidentiality must be filed and maintained in a public file. The request for confidentiality must be filed and maintained in a confidential file. (B) Notwithstanding denial of a request to keep the minor's address confidential, the address may be confidential under other statutory provisions. (C) Service (i) If a request for confidentiality is denied and the request for restraining order has been withdrawn, and if no other action is pending before the court in the case, then the Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential (form DV-160) and Order on Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential (form DV-165) must not be served on the other party, or both parties if the person making the request for confidentiality is not a party to the action. (ii) If a request for confidentiality is denied and the request for restraining order has not been withdrawn, or if an action between the same parties is pending before the court, then the Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential (form DV-160) and Order on Request to Keep Minor's Information Confidential (form DV-165) must be served on the other party, or both parties if the person making the request for confidentiality is not a party to the action. (f) Procedures to protect confidential information when order is granted (1) If a request for confidentiality is granted in whole or in part, the court, in its discretion, and taking into consideration the factors stated in (g), must ensure that the order granting confidentiality is maintained in the most effective manner by: (A) The judicial officer redacting all information to be kept confidential from all applicable documents; (B) Ordering the requesting party or the requesting party's attorney to prepare a redacted copy of all applicable documents and submit all redacted copies to the court for review and filing; or (C) Ordering any other procedure that facilitates the prompt and accurate preparation of a redacted copy of all applicable documents in compliance with the court's order granting confidentiality, provided the selected procedure is consistent with (g). (2) The redacted copy or copies must be filed and maintained in a public file, and the unredacted copy or copies must be filed and maintained in a confidential file. (3) Information that is made confidential from the public and the restrained person must be filed in a confidential file accessible only to the minor or minors who are subjects of the order of confidentiality, or legal guardian who requested confidentiality, law enforcement for enforcement purposes only, and the court. (4) Any information that is made confidential from the restrained person must be redacted from the copy that will be served on the restrained person. (g) Factors in selecting redaction procedures In determining the procedures to follow under (f), the court must consider the following factors: (1) Whether the requesting party is represented by an attorney; (2) Whether the requesting party has immediate access to a self-help center or other legal assistance; (3) Whether the requesting party is capable of preparing redacted materials without assistance; (4) Whether the redactions to the applicable documents are simple or complex; and (5) When applicable, whether the selected procedure will ensure that the orders on the request for restraining order and the request for confidentiality are entered in an expeditious and timely manner. (h) Releasing minor's confidential information (1) To respondent Information about a minor must be shared with the respondent only as provided in Family Code section 6301.5(d)(1) (B), limited to information necessary to allow the respondent to respond to the request for the protective order and to comply with the confidentiality order and the protective order. (2) To law enforcement Information about a minor must be shared with law enforcement only as provided in Family Code section 6301.5(d) (1)(A) or by court order. (3) To other persons If the court finds it is necessary to prevent abuse within the meaning of Family Code section 6220, or is in the best interest of the minor, the court may release confidential information on the request of any person or entity or on the court's own motion. (A) Request for release of confidential information (i) Any person or entity may request the release of confidential information by filing Request for Release of Minor's Confidential Information (form DV-176) and a proposed order, Order on Request for Release of Minor's Confidential Information (form DV-179), with the court.

(B) Opportunity to object (i) The person who made the request for confidentiality has the right to object by filing form DV-178 within 20 days from the date of the mailing of form DV-177, or verbally objecting at a hearing, if one is held. (ii) The person filing a response must serve a copy of the response (form DV-178) on the person requesting release of confidential information. Service must occur before filing the response form with the court unless the response form contains confidential information. If the response form contains confidential information, service must be done as soon as possible after the response form has been redacted. (iii) If the person who made the request for confidentiality objects to the release of information, the court may set the matter for a closed hearing. (C) Rulings The request may be granted or denied in whole or in part without a hearing. Alternatively, the court may set the matter for hearing on at least 10 days' notice to the person who made the request for release of confidential information and the person who made the request for confidential information. Any hearing must be confidential. (i) Order granting release of confidential information a. The order (form DV-179) granting the release of confidential information must be prepared in a manner consistent with the procedures outlined in (f). b. A redacted copy of the order (form DV-179) must be filed in a public file and an unredacted copy of the order must be filed in a confidential file. c. Service If the court grants the request for release of information based on the pleadings, the court must mail a copy of form DV-179 to the person who filed form DV-176 and the person who made the request to keep the minor's information confidential. Parties may be served in court if present at the hearing. (ii) Order denying request to release minor's confidential information a. The court may deny a request to release confidential information based on the request alone. b. The order (form DV-179) denying the release of confidential information must be filed in a public file and must not include any confidential information. c. Service If the court denies the request for release of information based on the pleadings, the court must mail a copy of form DV-179 to the person who filed form DV-176 and the person who made the request to keep the minor's information confidential. Parties may be served in court if present at the hearing. (iii) If the court finds that the request to release confidential information is insufficiently specific to meet the requirements under Family Code section 6301.5(d)(3), the court may conduct a closed hearing to determine if there are additional facts that would support granting the request. The court may receive any relevant evidence, including testimony from the person requesting release of the minor's confidential information, the minor, the legal guardian, the person who requested the restraining order, or other competent witness. (Subd (h) amended effective September 1, 2020.) (i) Protecting information in subsequent filings and other civil cases (1) Filings made after an order granting confidentiality (A) A party seeking to file a document or form after an order for confidentiality has been made must submit the Cover Sheet for Confidential Information (form DV-175) attached to the front of the document to be filed. (B) Upon receipt of form DV-175 with attached documents, the court must: (i) Order a procedure for redaction consistent with the procedures stated in (f); (ii) File the unredacted document in the confidential file pending receipt of the redacted document if the redacted document is not prepared on the same court day; and (iii) File the redacted document in the public file after it has been reviewed and approved by the court for accuracy. (2) Other civil case (A) Information subject to an order of confidentiality issued under Family Code section 6301.5 must be kept confidential in any family law case and any other civil case with the same parties. (B) The minor or person making the request for confidentiality and any person who has been served with a notice of confidentiality must submit a copy of the order of confidentiality (form DV-165) in any family law case and any other civil case with the same parties. (Subd (i) amended effective September 1, 2020.) Rule 5.382 amended effective September 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 2019. Advisory Committee Comment Subdivisions (a), (b), (d), and (e). The process described in this rule need not be used if the request for confidentiality is merely to keep an address confidential and the minor has a mailing address which does not need to be kept private that can be listed on the forms, or if the minor's address can be made confidential under Family Code section 3429. In addition, the address need not be listed on the protective order for enforcement purposes under Family Code section 6225. The restraining order forms do not require the address of the nonpetitioning minor. This rule and rule 2.551 provide a standard and procedures for courts to follow when a request is made to seal a record. The standard as reflected in Family Code section 6301.5 is based on NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. The standard recognizes the First Amendment right of access to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication.",

(d) No waiver on file-sibling requesting contact If, after contacting the department or licensed adoption agency, the sibling who is seeking contact learns that no waiver is on file for the other sibling, the sibling seeking contact should use the following procedure to ask the court that finalized the adoption of either sibling to designate a confidential intermediary to help locate the other sibling: (1) Sibling's request CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (A) A sibling requesting contact under Family Code section 9205 must file a petition and submit a blank order to the court that finalized the adoption of either sibling. (B) If the sibling requesting contact is under the age of 18 years, the petition must be filed through the sibling's duly appointed guardian ad litem under Code of Civil Procedure section 373 or through the sibling's attorney. (2) Appointment of a confidential intermediary (A) The court must grant the petition unless the court finds that it would be detrimental to the adoptee or sibling with whom contact is sought. The court may consider any and all relevant information in making this determination, including, but not limited to, a review of the court file. (B) The court will appoint the department or licensed adoption agency that provided adoption services for either sibling as the confidential intermediary. (C) If the court finds that the licensed adoption agency that conducted the adoptee's adoption is unable to serve as the intermediary, owing to economic hardship, the court may then appoint any one of the following who agrees to serve as an alternate confidential intermediary: (i) A CASA volunteer or CASA program staff member; (ii) A court-connected mediator; (iii) An adoption service provider as defined in Family Code section 8502(a); (iv) An attorney; or (v) Another California licensed adoption agency or the California Department of Social Services' Adoptions Support Bureau when no other individuals are available. (D) When an alternate confidential intermediary is appointed, the licensed adoption agency must provide to the court all records related to the adoptee or sibling for inspection by the alternate confidential intermediary. (3) Role of the confidential intermediary (A) The confidential intermediary must: (i) Have access to all records of the adoptee or the sibling, including the court adoption file and adoption agency or CDSS files of either sibling; (ii) Make all reasonable efforts to locate the adoptee, the sibling, or the adoptive or birth parent; (iii) Attempt to obtain the consent of the adoptee, the sibling, or the adoptive or birth parent; and (iv) Notify any located adoptee, sibling, or adoptive or birth parent that consent is optional, not required by law, and does not affect the status of the adoption. (B) The confidential intermediary must not make any further attempts to obtain consent if the individual denies the request for consent. (C) The confidential intermediary must use information found in the records of the adoptee or the sibling for authorized purposes only and must not disclose any information obtained in this procedure unless specifically authorized. (4) Adopted sibling seeking contact with a sibling who is a dependent child An adoptee seeking contact with his or her sibling who is a dependent child must follow the procedure set forth under Welfare and Institutions Code section 388(b) to seek contact with the sibling.

CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (3) No negotiation of violence Family Court Services staff must not negotiate with the parties about using violence with each other, whether either party should or should not obtain or dismiss a restraining order, or whether either party should cooperate with criminal prosecution. (4) em] Domestic violence restraining orders Notwithstanding the above, to the extent permitted under Family Code section 3183(c), in appropriate cases, Family Court Services staff may recommend that restraining orders be issued, pending determination of the controversy, to protect the well-being of the child involved in the controversy. (5) Providing information Family Court Services staff must provide information to families accessing their services about the effects of domestic violence on adults and children. Family Court Services programs, including but not limited to orientation programs, must provide information and materials that describe Family Court Services policy and procedures with respect to domestic violence. Whenever possible, information delivered in video or audiovisual format should be closed-captioned. (6) Separate sessions In a Family Court Services case in which there has been a history of domestic violence between the parties or in which a protective order as defined in Family Code section 6218 is in effect, at the request of the party who is alleging domestic violence in a written declaration under penalty of perjury or who is protected by the order, the Family Court Services mediator, counselor, evaluator, or investigator must meet with the parties separately and at separate times. When appropriate, arrangements for separate sessions must protect the confidentiality of each party's times of arrival, departure, and meeting with Family Court Services. Family Court Services must provide information to the parties regarding their options for separate sessions under Family Code sections 3113 and 3181. If domestic violence is discovered after mediation or evaluation has begun, the Family Court Services staff member assigned to the case must confer with the parties separately regarding safety-related issues and the option of continuing in separate sessions at separate times. Family Court Services staff, including support staff, must not respond to a party's request for separate sessions as though it were evidence of his or her lack of cooperation with the Family Court Services process. (7) Referrals Family Court Services staff, where applicable, must refer family members to appropriate services. Such services may include but are not limited to programs for perpetrators, counseling and education for children, parent education, services for victims, and legal resources, such as family law facilitators. (8) Community resources Family Court Services should maintain a liaison with community-based services offering domestic violence prevention assistance and support so that referrals can be made based on an understanding of available services and service providers. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 2003.) (e) Intake (1) Court responsibility Each court must ensure that Family Court Services programs use a detailed intake process that screens for, and informs staff about, any restraining orders, dependency petitions under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, and other safety-related issues affecting any party or child named in the proceedings. (2) Intake form Any intake form that an agency charged with providing family court services requires the parties to complete before the commencement of mediation or evaluation must state that, if a party alleging domestic violence in a written declaration under penalty of perjury or a party protected by a protective order so requests, the Family Court Services staff must meet with the parties separately and at separate times. (3) Review of intake form and case file All Family Court Services procedures must be conducted in accordance with state law and must include review of intake forms and court files, when available, by appropriate staff. (f) Screening (1) Identification of domestic violence Screening for a history of domestic violence incidents must be done throughout the Family Court Services process. As early in the case as possible, Family Court Services staff should make every effort to identify cases in which incidents of domestic violence are present. The means by which Family Court Services elicits screening information may be determined by each program. Screening techniques may include but are not limited to questionnaires, telephone interviews, standardized screening devices, and face-to-face interviews. (2) Procedures for identification Procedures for identifying domestic violence may include, but are not limited to: (a) determination of an existing emergency protective order or domestic violence restraining order concerning the parties or minor; (b) review of court papers and declarations; (c) telephone interviews; (d) use of an intake form; (e) orientation; (f) information from attorneys, shelters, hospital reports, Child Protective Services, police reports, and criminal background checks; and (g) other collateral sources. Questions specific to incidents of domestic violence should request the following information: date of the parties' separation, frequency of domestic violence, most recent as well as past incidents of domestic violence, concerns about future domestic violence, identities of children and other individuals present at domestic violence incidents or otherwise exposed to the domestic violence, and severity of domestic violence. (3) Context for screening In domestic violence cases in which neither party has requested separate sessions at separate times, Family Court Services staff must confer with the parties separately and privately to determine whether joint or separate sessions are appropriate. (g) Safety issues (1) Developing a safety plan When domestic violence is identified or alleged in a case, Family Court Services staff must consult with the party alleging domestic violence away from the presence of the party against whom such allegations are made and discuss the existence of or need for a safety plan. Safety planning may include but is not limited to discussion of safe housing, workplace safety, safety for other family members and children, access to financial resources, and information about local domestic violence agencies. (2) Safety procedures Each Family Court Services office should develop safety procedures for handling domestic violence cases. (3) Confidential addresses Where appropriate, Family Court Services staff must make reasonable efforts to keep residential addresses, work addresses, and contact information-including but not limited to telephone numbers and e-mail addresses- confidential in all cases and on all Family Court Services documents. (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (h) Support persons (1) Support person Family Court Services staff must advise the party protected by a protective order of the right to have a support person attend any mediation orientation or mediation sessions, including separate mediation sessions, under Family Code section 6303. (2) Excluding support person A Family Court Services staff person may exclude a domestic violence support person from a mediation session if the support person participates in the mediation session or acts as an advocate or the presence of a particular support person disrupts the process of mediation. The presence of the support person does not waive the confidentiality of the process, and the support person is bound by the confidentiality of the process. (Subd (h) amended effective January 1, 2003.) (i) Accessibility of services To effectively address domestic violence cases, the court must make reasonable efforts to ensure the availability of safe and accessible services that include, but are not limited to: (1) Language accessibility Whenever possible, Family Court Services programs should be conducted in the languages of all participants, including those who are deaf. When the participants use only a language other than spoken English and the Family Court Services staff person does not speak their language, an interpreter-certified whenever possible-should be assigned to interpret at the session. A minor child of the parties must not be used as an interpreter. An adult family member may act as an interpreter only when appropriate interpreters are not available. When a family member is acting as an interpreter, Family Court Services staff should attempt to establish, away from the presence of the potential interpreter and the other party, whether the person alleging domestic violence is comfortable with having that family member interpret for the parties. (2) Facilities design To minimize contact between the parties and promote safety in domestic violence cases, courts must give consideration to the design of facilities. Such considerations must include but are not limited to the following: separate and secure waiting areas, separate conference rooms for parent education and mediation, signs providing directions to Family Court Services, and secure parking for users of Family Court Services. (j) Training and education (1) Training, continuing education, and experience requirements for Family Court Services staff All Family Court Services staff must participate in programs of continuing instruction in issues related to domestic violence, including child abuse, as may be arranged for and provided to them, under Family Code section 1816(a). (2) Advanced domestic violence training Family Court Services staff must complete 16 hours of advanced domestic violence training within the first 12 months of employment and 4 hours of domestic violence update training each year thereafter. The content of the 16 hours of advanced domestic violence training and 4 hours of domestic violence update training must be the same as that required for court-appointed child custody investigators and evaluators as stated in rule 5.230. Those staff members employed by Family Court Services on January 1, 2002, who have not already fulfilled the requirements of rule 5.230 must participate in the 16-hour training within one year of the rule's effective date. (3) Support staff Family Court Services programs should, where possible, enable support staff, including but not limited to clerical staff, to participate in training on domestic violence and in handling domestic violence cases appropriately.

(3) Election The defendant must file a Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) with the clerk by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear or the extended due date as provided in (2).

(4) Bail The defendant must deposit bail with the clerk by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear or the extended due date as provided in (2). (5) Instructions to arresting officer If the clerk receives the defendant's Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) and bail by the due date, the clerk must deliver or mail to the arresting officer's agency Notice and Instructions to Arresting Officer (form TR-210) and Officer's Declaration (form TR-235) with a copy of the Notice to Appear and a specified return date for receiving the officer's declaration.

(Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2000.) (c) Due dates and time limits Due dates and time limits must be as stated in this rule, unless changed or extended by the court. The court may extend any date, but the court need not state the reasons for granting or denying an extension on the record or in the minutes. (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (d) Ineligible defendants If the defendant requests a trial by written declaration and the clerk or the court determines that the defendant is not eligible for a trial by written declaration, the clerk must extend the due date 25 calendar days and notify the defendant by mail of the determination and due date. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (e) Noncompliance If the defendant does not comply with this rule (including submitting the required bail amount, signing and filing all required forms, and complying with all time limits and due dates), the court may deny a trial by written declaration and may proceed as otherwise provided by statute and court rules. (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (f) Evidence Testimony and other relevant evidence may be introduced in the form of a Notice to Appear issued under Vehicle Code section 40500; a business record or receipt; a sworn declaration of the arresting officer; and, on behalf of the defendant, a sworn declaration of the defendant. (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (g) Fines, assessments, or penalties The statute and the rules do not prevent or preclude the court from imposing on a defendant who is found guilty any lawful fine, assessment, or other penalty, and the court is not limited to imposing money penalties in the bail amount, unless the bail amount is the maximum and the only lawful penalty. (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2007.) (h) Additional forms and procedures The clerk may approve and prescribe forms, time limits, and procedures that are not in conflict with or not inconsistent with the statute or this rule.

(2) \"Court litigant\" is a person who is a party in a court case or other legal proceeding. (3) \"Language services\" are services designed to provide access to the legal system to limited English proficient court litigants and may include in-person interpretation, telephonic interpreter services, video remote interpreting services, and services provided by assigned bilingual employees and bilingual volunteers. (4) \"Limited English proficient\" describes a person who speaks English \"less than very well\" and who, as a result, cannot understand or participate in a court proceeding. (5) \"Private programs, services, and professionals\" are services provided by outside agencies, organizations, and persons that court litigants may be required to access by court order.  (b) Provision of language services in court-ordered and court-provided programs, services, and professionals  As soon as feasible, each court must adopt procedures to enable limited English proficient court litigants to access court- ordered and court-provided programs, services, and professionals to the same extent as persons who are proficient in English.  (c) Provision of language services in private programs and services, and by private professionals  To the extent feasible, a court should avoid ordering a limited English proficient court litigant to a private program, service, or professional that is not language accessible.  (d) Delay in access to services  If a limited English proficient court litigant is unable to access a private program, service, or professional within the time period ordered by the court due to limitations in language service availability, the court litigant may submit a statement to the court indicating the reason for the delay, and the court may, for good cause, enter an alternative order or extend the time for completion. Court litigants may use   Service Not Available in My Language: Request to Change Court Order   (form LA- 400) for this purpose. The court may respond to the request using   Service Not Available in My Language: Order   (form LA-450).  (e) Use of technology  Courts should seek out opportunities to collaborate with each other and with community partners in the provision of language services, and should employ technology to promote the sharing of bilingual staff and certified and registered court interpreters among courts, as appropriate.

The goal of this rule is to connect limited English proficient court litigants ordered by courts to access programs or professionals with services in the languages spoken by the litigants. Recognizing that not all program providers will be willing or able to meet the language needs, the rule is intended to help courts become aware of those language services available in the community so that limited English proficient court litigants are not placed in a position where they are unable to comply with court orders because the required services are not available in a language they understand. To facilitate equal access to justice, when courts order limited English proficient litigants to access court-provided programs, services, and professionals, to the greatest extent possible, courts should ensure that the services are language accessible. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 To the extent feasible and as permitted by law, any memorandum of understanding or other written agreement for agency- referred programs, services, and professionals that trial courts enter into or amend after the implementation date of this rule should include the goals of providing language services in the languages spoken by limited English proficient court users and of notifying the court if the language needs of a limited English proficient court litigant referred to the program, service, or professional cannot be accommodated. Subdivision (c). Courts are encouraged to offer neutral, nonendorsing information about private programs, services, and professionals providing multilingual services or language assistance to enable limited English proficient court litigants to access their programs. Private programs, services, and professionals that would like to be included on a court's informational list may confirm in writing to the court annually that they offer language services, indicating the languages covered by the program, service, or professional. Courts may require providers to use Notice of Available Language Assistance-Service Provider (form LA-350) for this purpose. Subdivision (d). When a defendant is required to participate in a batterer intervention program under section 1203.097(a)(6) of the California Penal Code, the court may order \"another appropriate counseling program\" if a batterer's program is unavailable in the language spoken by the court litigant. In addition, a judge may, for good cause, excuse the requirement to complete the 52- week program within 18 months. The application of a similar standard to all orders to participate in noncourtroom services, whereby the unavailability of language assistance would constitute good cause to make an alternative order or to excuse delay in completion, would provide the court with flexibility to address situations in which a program or service is unavailable in the language spoken by a limited English proficient court user. Two optional forms, Service Not Available in My Language: Request to Change Court Order (form LA-400) and Service Not Available in My Language: Order (form LA-450), were developed to facilitate communication between the court and a limited English proficient court litigant who is unable to comply with a court order because of a lack of language assistance. Form LA-400 allows the court litigant to notify the court of the unavailability of language assistance in a court-ordered program and to request a modified order or an extension of the time for completion of the program. Form LA-450 allows the court to issue a modified order or to extend the time for completion of a court-ordered program or service. A request may be denied if the court receives information that a program is available in the language of the court litigant or that language assistance is available to help the court litigant access the program, and that the program or service may be accessed within the time mandated by the court for completion. If a request is denied on this basis, the court should provide contact information that will allow the court litigant to access the program. In addition, a request may be denied if the court finds there is good cause to believe that the request was brought for an improper purpose or that the court litigant knowingly provided false information on form LA-400. Subdivision (e). It is the policy of the California courts to encourage the efficient and effective use of human and technological resources in the provision of language services while ensuring meaningful access for limited English proficient court users. For noncourtroom interpretation events, courts may consult the report, Technological Options for Providing and Sharing Court Language Access Services Outside the Courtroom (January 2018) for opportunities to collaborate with other courts and service providers to enhance language access for LEP court users.",

(d) Use of data and development of measures before CCMS implementation Before CCMS implementation, the Judicial Council must: (1) Establish a program to assist the local courts in collecting, preparing, analyzing, and reporting the data required by this rule; (2) Establish a procedure to assist the local courts in submitting the required data to the Judicial Council; (3) Use the data submitted under (c)(2) to test and refine the detailed definitions of the performance measures and descriptions of the methods for producing the performance measures described in the Implementation Guide to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures; (4) Consult with local courts about the accuracy of the data submitted under (c)(2). After such consultation, use data to generate aggregate data reports on performance measures, consistent with section 16543, while not disclosing identifying information about children, parents, judicial officers, and other individuals in the dependency system; and (5) Assist the courts in using the data to achieve improved outcomes for children and families in the dependency system, make systemic improvements, and improve resource allocation decisions. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016.) (e) Use of data after CCMS implementation On implementation of CCMS, the Judicial Council must: (1) Use the data submitted under (c)(3) to conduct ongoing testing, refining, and updating of the information in the Implementation Guide to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures; (2) Use the data submitted under (c)(3) to generate aggregate data reports on performance measures, consistent with section 16543, while not disclosing identifying information about children, parents, judicial officers, and other individuals in the dependency system; (3) Upon the request of any local court, extract data from the system and prepare county-level reports to meet data reporting requirements; and (4) Assist the courts in using the data to achieve improved outcomes for children and families in the dependency system, make systemic improvements, and improve resource allocation decisions. (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2016.) Rule 5.505 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2009. Advisory Committee Comment The juvenile dependency court performance measures and related procedures set forth in this rule fulfill the requirements of the Child Welfare Leadership and Accountability Act of 2006 (Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 16540-16545). Consistent with section 16545, the Child Welfare Council and the secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency were consulted in adopting these performance measures. The appropriate court technology groups have also been consulted. The Implementation Guide to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures is a companion publication to this rule, approved by the Judicial Council. It is anticipated that the Judicial Council will update the Implementation Guide to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures , as appropriate, to stay current with Court Case Management System (CCMS) requirements, local court needs, and the most recent versions of the relevant state and federal child welfare measures. Proposed updates other than those that are purely technical will be circulated for public comment prior to publication.",

The rule applies to presumptive transfer following any change of placement within California for a child or nonminor to a placement that is outside the county of original jurisdiction, including the initial placement. Nothing in this rule relieves the placing agency of the reporting requirements and duties under section 14717.1 when no hearing under this rule is held.  (b) Requesting a hearing to review the request for waiver of presumptive transfer (§ 14717.1)  (1) The following persons or agencies may make a request to the placing agency that presumptive transfer be waived and that the responsibility for providing specialty mental health services remain in the child's or nonminor's county of original jurisdiction: (A) The foster child or nonminor; (B) The person or agency that is responsible for making mental health care decisions on behalf of the foster child or nonminor; (C) The child welfare services agency or the probation agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child or nonminor; and (D) Any other interested party who owes a legal duty to the child or nonminor involving the child's or nonminor's health or welfare, as defined by the department.

(2) The person or agency who requested the waiver, or any other party to the case who disagrees with the placing agency's determination on the request for the waiver of presumptive transfer, may request a judicial review of the placing agency's determination. (3) A request for a hearing must be made by filing a Request for Hearing on Waiver of Presumptive Transfer (form JV-214). If a hearing is requested, form JV-214 must be provided to the placing agency within seven court days of the petitioner's being noticed of the placing agency's determination on the request for waiver of presumptive transfer. (4) When a hearing is requested in (b)(3), the transfer of the responsibility for providing specialty mental health services cannot occur until the court makes a ruling as required in (c)(1). (c) Setting of a hearing (§ 14717.1) (1) The court on its own motion may direct the clerk to set a hearing no later than five court days after the request for a hearing was filed, or may deny the request for a hearing without ruling on the transfer of jurisdiction. (2) If the court sets a hearing, the clerk must provide notice of the hearing date to: (A) The parents-unless parental rights have been terminated-or guardians of the child; (B) The petitioner; (C) The social worker or probation officer; (D) The mental health care decision maker for the child or nonminor, if one has been appointed under section 361(a) (1); (E) The Indian child's tribe, if applicable, as defined in rule 5.502; (F) The child-if 10 years of age or older-or nonminor; and (G) All other persons entitled to notice under section 293 or section 727.4(a). CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (3) If the court grants a hearing under (c)(1), responsibility for providing specialty mental health services cannot be transferred until the court makes a ruling as required in (e)(2) and section 14717.1(d)(4). (d) Reports When a hearing is granted under (c)(1), the social worker or probation officer must provide a report including discussion or documentation of the following: (1) The placing agency's rationale for its decision on the request for a waiver of presumptive transfer, including: (A) Any requests for waiver, and the exceptions claimed as the basis for those requests; (B) The placing agency's determination of whether waiver of presumptive transfer is appropriate under section 14717.1(d)(5)(A)-(D); (C) Any objections to the placing agency's determination in (B); and (D) The ways that the child's or nonminor's best interests will be promoted by the placing agency's presumptive transfer determination. (2) That the child or nonminor, his or her parents if applicable, the child and family team, and others who serve the child or nonminor as appropriate-such as the therapist, mental health care decision maker for the child or nonminor if one has been appointed under section 361(a)(1), and Court Appointed Special Advocate volunteer-were consulted regarding the waiver determination. (3) That notice of the placing agency's determination of whether to waive presumptive transfer was provided to the individual who requested waiver of presumptive transfer, along with all parties to the case. (4) Whether the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrates an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into a contract with a specialty mental health care provider within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the foster child or nonminor. (5) The child's or nonminor's current provision of specialty mental health services, and how those services will be affected by the placing agency's presumptive transfer determination. (e) Conduct at the hearing (1) The social worker or probation officer must provide the report in (d) to the court, all parties to the case, and the person or agency that requested the waiver no later than two court days after the hearing is set under (c)(1). (2) At the hearing, the court may confirm or deny the transfer of jurisdiction or application of an exception based on the best interests of the child or nonminor. A waiver of presumptive transfer is contingent on the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrating an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into such a contract within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the child or nonminor. (3) The person or agency that requested the waiver of presumptive transfer bears the burden to show that an exception to presumptive transfer is in the best interests of the child or nonminor by a preponderance of the evidence. (4) The hearing must conclude within five court days of the initial hearing date, unless a showing of good cause consistent with section 352 or section 682 supports a continuance of the hearing beyond five days. (5) When considering whether it is in the child's or nonminor's best interests to confirm or deny the request for a waiver of presumptive transfer, the court may consider the following in addition to any other factors the court deems relevant: (A) The child's or nonminor's access to specialty mental health services, the current provision of specialty mental health services to the child or nonminor, and whether any important service relationships will be affected by the transfer of jurisdiction or a waiver of presumptive transfer; (B) If reunification services are being provided, the impact that the transfer of jurisdiction would have on reunification services; (C) The anticipated length of stay in the child's or nonminor's new placement; (D) The position of the child or nonminor, or of the child's or nonminor's attorney, on presumptive transfer; and (E) The ability to maintain specialty mental health services in the county of original jurisdiction or to arrange for specialty mental health services in the county of residence after the child or nonminor changes placements. (6) Findings and orders must be made on Order after Hearing on Waiver of Presumptive Transfer (form JV-215). (f) Existing out-of-county placement This rule applies to presumptive transfer for any child or nonminor who resided in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction after June 30, 2017, and who continues to reside outside his or her county of original jurisdiction after December 31, 2017, and has not had a presumptive transfer determination as required under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1(c)(2). Unless amended by Judicial Council action effective after the effective date of this rule, this subdivision will be repealed effective January 1, 2020. Rule 5.647 adopted effective September 1, 2018. Advisory Committee Comment The exceptions to the presumptive transfer of the responsibility to provide for and arrange for specialty mental health services to the county of the child's or nonminor's out-of-county residence are found in Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1(d)(5) (A-D). A court review hearing under this rule may not necessarily be common, but under section 14717.1(d)(7), for all cases, a request for waiver, the exceptions claimed as the basis for the request, a determination whether a waiver is appropriate under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1, and any objections to the determination must be documented in the child's or nonminor's case plan under Welfare and Institutions Code section 16501.1. The Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services are responsible for providing policy guidance and regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1299 (Ridley-Thomas; Stats. 2016, ch. 603). The policy guidance and regulations should be used during the administrative process related to presumptive transfer. This would include determining who is entitled to make a request for waiver under (b)(1)(D) of the rule and section 14717.1(d)(2), where \"department\" refers to the Department of Health Care Services. In the policy guidance and regulations, the Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services will determine who owes a legal duty to the child or nonminor and thus may request a waiver of presumptive transfer. In addition, the policy guidance and regulations will address the timelines for the period to request a hearing. Presumptive transfer cannot occur until the court has made a ruling on the request for a hearing, and if a hearing is granted, makes a ruling as required in (c)(3). In accordance with the policy guidance issued by the Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services, the delivery of existing specialty mental health services to the child or nonminor must however continue without interruption, and be provided or arranged for, and paid for by the Mental Health Plan in the county of original jurisdiction until the court makes a ruling on the request for a hearing or makes a ruling as required in (c)(3) if a hearing is granted.",

After receipt of the form, the clerk must notify the persons in (e)(2)(A)(ii) of the hearing date. (C) The court on its own motion may direct the clerk to set a hearing.

(Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2014.) (f) Court review of proposed change of placement affecting the right to attend the school of origin (1) At a hearing set under (e)(2), the court must: (A) Determine whether the placement agency and other relevant parties and advocates have fulfilled their obligations under section 16000(b), 16010(a), and 16501.1(f)(8); (B) Determine whether the proposed school placement meets the requirements of this rule and Education Code sections 48853.5 and 49069.5, and whether the placement is in the best interest of the child or youth; (C) Determine what actions are necessary to ensure the protection of the child's or youth's educational and developmental-services rights; and (D) Make any findings and orders needed to enforce those rights, which may include an order to set a hearing under section 362 to join the necessary agencies regarding provision of services, including the provision of transportation services, so that the child or youth may remain in his or her school of origin. (2) When considering whether it is in the child's or youth's best interest to remove him or her from the school of origin, the court must consider the following: (A) Whether the parent, guardian, or other educational rights holder believes that removal from the school of origin is in the child's or youth's best interest; (B) How the proposed change of placement will affect the stability of the child's or youth's school placement and the child's or youth's access to academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities; (C) Whether the proposed school placement would allow the child or youth to be placed in the least restrictive educational program; and (D) Whether the child or youth has the educational and developmental services and supports, including those for special education and related services, necessary to meet state academic achievement standards. (3) The court may make its findings and orders on Findings and Orders Regarding Transfer From School of Origin (form JV- 538). (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2014.) Rule 5.651 amended effective January 1, 2014; adopted effective January 1, 2008. Advisory Committee Comment A child or youth in, or at risk of entering, foster care has a statutory right to a meaningful opportunity to meet the state's academic achievement standards. To protect this right, the juvenile court, advocates, placing agencies, care providers, educators, and service providers must work together to maintain stable school placements and ensure that the child or youth is placed in the least restrictive educational programs and has access to the academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to other pupils. This rule, sections 362 and 727, and rule 5.575 provide procedures for coordinating the provision of services to ensure that the child's or youth's educational and developmental-services needs are met. Congress has found that improving the educational performance of children with disabilities is an essential prerequisite to ensuring their equality of opportunity, full participation in education, and economic self-sufficiency. Children and youth in foster care are disproportionately represented in the population of pupils with disabilities and face systemic challenges to attaining self- sufficiency. Children and youth in foster care have rights arising out of federal and state law, including the IDEA, the ADA, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To comply with federal requirements regarding the identification of children and youth with disabilities and the provision of services to those children and youth who qualify, the court, parent or guardian, placing agency, attorneys, CASA volunteer, local educational agencies, and educational rights holders must affirmatively address the child's or youth's educational and developmental-services needs. The court must continually inquire about the educational and developmental-services needs of the child or youth and the progress being made to enforce any rights the child or youth has under these laws.",

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (c)(1). Rule 4.104(c)(1) reflects that under Vehicle Code sections 1808.10, 41501, and 42005, the record of a driver with a class A, class B, or commercial class C license who completes a traffic violator school program is not confidential and must be reported to and disclosed by the Department of Motor Vehicles for purposes of Title 49 of the Federal Code of Regulations and to insurers for underwriting and rating purposes. Subdivision (c)(2). Rule 4.104(c)(2) reflects court rulings in cases where defendants wished to plead not guilty and have the court order attendance of traffic violator school if found guilty after trial. A court has discretion to grant or not grant traffic violator school. ( People v. Schindler (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 431, 433; People v. Levinson (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 21.) However, the court may not arbitrarily refuse to consider a request for traffic violator school because a defendant pleads not guilty. ( Schindler, supra, at p. 433; People v. Wozniak (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d Supp. 43, 44; People v. Enochs (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d Supp. 42, 44.) If a judicial officer believes that a defendant's circumstances indicate that a defendant would benefit from attending school, such attendance should be authorized and should not be affected by the order in which the plea, explanation, and request for traffic violator school are presented. ( Enochs, supra, at p. 44.) A court is not required to state its reasons for granting or denying traffic violator school following a defendant's conviction for a traffic violation.

(c) Procedure for consideration of good cause for failure to appear or pay  (1) A notice of a civil assessment under section 1214.1(b) must inform the defendant of his or her right to petition that the civil assessment be vacated for good cause and must include information about the process for vacating or reducing the assessment. (2) When a notice of civil assessment is given, a defendant may, within the time specified in the notice, move by written petition to vacate or reduce the assessment. (3) When a court imposes a civil assessment for failure to appear or pay, the defendant may petition that the court vacate or reduce the civil assessment without paying any bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments. (4) A petition to vacate an assessment does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessment unless specifically ordered by the court.

(7) In exercising its discretion, the court may consider such factors as a defendant's due diligence in appearing or paying after notice of the assessment has been given under section 1214.1(b)(1) and the defendant's financial circumstances.  (d) Procedure for unpaid bail referred to collection as delinquent debt in unadjudicated cases  (1) When a case has not been adjudicated and a court refers it to a comprehensive collection program as provided in section 1463.007(b)(1) as delinquent debt, the defendant may schedule a hearing for adjudication of the underlying charge(s) without payment of the bail amount. (2) The defendant may request an appearance date to adjudicate the underlying charges by written petition or alternative method provided by the court. Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance. (3) A court may require a deposit of bail before adjudication of the underlying charges if the court finds that the defendant is unlikely to appear as ordered without a deposit of bail and the court expressly states the reasons for the finding. The court must not require payment of the civil assessment before adjudication.  (e) Procedure for failure to pay or make a payment under an installment payment plan  (1) When a defendant fails to pay a fine or make a payment under an installment plan as provided in section 1205 or Vehicle Code sections 40510.5, 42003, or 42007, the court must permit the defendant to appear by written petition to modify the payment terms.

Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (2) The court must not require payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments to consider the petition. (3) The petition to modify the payment terms does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments unless specifically ordered by the court. (4) If the defendant petitions to modify the payment terms based on an inability to pay, the procedures stated in rule 4.335 apply. (5) If the petition to modify the payment terms is not based on an inability to pay, the court may deny the defendant's request to modify the payment terms and order no further proceedings if the court determines that: (A) An unreasonable amount of time has passed; or (B) The defendant has made an unreasonable number of requests to modify the payment terms. (f) Procedure after a trial by written declaration in absentia for a traffic infraction When the court issues a judgment under Vehicle Code section 40903 and a defendant requests a trial de novo within the time permitted, courts may require the defendant to deposit bail. (g) Procedure for referring a defendant to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for license suspension for failure to pay a fine Before a court may notify the DMV under Vehicle Code sections 40509(b) or 40509.5(b) that a defendant has failed to pay a fine or an installment of bail, the court must provide the defendant with notice of and an opportunity to be heard on the inability to pay. This notice may be provided on the notice required in rule 4.107, the civil assessment notice, or any other notice provided to the defendant. Rule 4.106 adopted effective January 1, 2017 Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). The rule is intended to apply only to an infraction offense for which the defendant (1) has received a written notice to appear and (2) has failed to appear by the appearance date or an approved extension of that date or has failed to pay as required. Subdivision (c)(3). Circumstances that indicate good cause may include, but are not limited to, the defendant's hospitalization, incapacitation, or incarceration; military duty required of the defendant; death or hospitalization of the defendant's dependent or immediate family member; caregiver responsibility for a sick or disabled dependent or immediate family member of the defendant; or an extraordinary reason, beyond the defendant's control, that prevented the defendant from making an appearance or payment on or before the date listed on the notice to appear. Subdivision (e)(1 ). A court may exercise its discretion to deny a defendant's request to modify the payment terms. If the court chooses to grant the defendant's request, the court may modify the payment terms by reducing or suspending the base fine, lowering the payments, converting the remaining balance to community service, or otherwise modifying the payment terms as the court sees fit. Subdivision (g). A hearing is not required unless requested by the defendant or directed by the court.",

(Subd (a) amended effective January 22, 2019.)  (b) Purpose  This rule is intended to: (1) Assist courts issuing criminal protective orders to determine whether a defendant subject to such an order owns, possesses, or controls any firearms; and (2) Assist courts that have issued criminal protective orders to determine whether a defendant has complied with the court's order to relinquish or sell the firearms under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9.  (c) Setting review hearing  (1) At any hearing where the court issues a criminal protective order, the court must consider all credible information, including information provided on behalf of the defendant, to determine if there is good cause to believe that the defendant has a firearm within his or her immediate possession or control. (2) If the court finds good cause to believe that the defendant has a firearm within his or her immediate possession or control, the court must set a review hearing to ascertain whether the defendant has complied with the requirement to relinquish the firearm as specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9. Unless the defendant is in custody at the time, the review hearing should occur within two court days after issuance of the criminal protective order. If circumstances warrant, the court may extend the review hearing to occur within 5 court days after issuance of the criminal protective order. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to present information at the review hearing to refute the allegation that he or she owns any firearms. If the defendant is in custody at the time the criminal protective order is issued, the court should order the defendant to appear for a review hearing within two court days after the defendant's release from custody. (3) If the proceeding is held under Penal Code section 136.2, the court may, under Penal Code section 977(a)(2), order the defendant to personally appear at the review hearing. If the proceeding is held under Penal Code section 1203.097, the court should order the defendant to personally appear.  (d) Review hearing  (1) If the court has issued a criminal protective order under Penal Code section 136.2, at the review hearing: (A) If the court finds that the defendant has a firearm in or subject to his or her immediate possession or control, the court must consider whether bail, as set, or defendant's release on own recognizance is appropriate. (B) If the defendant does not appear at the hearing and the court orders that bail be revoked, the court should issue a bench warrant. (2) If the criminal protective order is issued as a condition of probation under Penal Code section 1203.097, and the court finds at the review hearing that the defendant has a firearm in or subject to his or her immediate possession or control, the court must proceed under Penal Code section 1203.097(a)(12). (3) In any review hearing to determine whether a defendant has complied with the requirement to relinquish firearms as specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9, the burden of proof is on the prosecution.

Rule 4.700 amended effective January 22, 2019; adopted effective July 1, 2010. CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 Advisory Committee Comment When issuing a criminal protective order under Penal Code section 136.2 or 1203.097(a)(2), the court is required to order a defendant \"to relinquish any firearm in that person's immediate possession or control, or subject to that person's immediate possession or control . . . .\" (Code Civ. Proc., § 527.9(b).) Mandatory Judicial Council form CR-160, Criminal Protective Order- Domestic Violence, includes a mandatory order in bold type that the defendant \"must surrender to local law enforcement or sell to a licensed gun dealer any firearm owned or subject to his or her immediate possession or control within 24 hours after service of this order and must file a receipt with the court showing compliance with this order within 48 hours of receiving this order.\" Courts are encouraged to develop local procedures to calendar review hearings for defendants in custody beyond the two-court- day time frame to file proof of firearms relinquishment with the court under Code of Civil Procedure section 527.9.",

(2) At the first appearance by a parent, Indian custodian, or guardian, and all other participants in any dependency case; or in juvenile wardship proceedings in which the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care; or at the initiation of any guardianship, conservatorship, proceeding for custody under Family Code section 3041, proceeding to terminate parental rights, proceeding to declare a child free of the custody and control of one or both parents, preadoptive placement, or adoption proceeding; and at each hearing that may culminate in an order for foster care placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement or adoptive placement, as described in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.1(d)(1), or that may result in an order for guardianship, conservatorship, or custody under Family Code section 3041; the court must: (A) Ask each participant present whether the participant knows or has reason to know the child is an Indian child; (B) Instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason to know the child is an Indian child; and (C) Order the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian, if available, to complete Parental Notification of Indian Status (form ICWA-020). (3) If the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian does not appear at the first hearing, or is unavailable at the initiation of a proceeding, the court must order the person or entity that has the inquiry duty under this rule to use reasonable diligence to find and inform the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian that the court has ordered the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian to complete Parental Notification of Indian Status (form ICWA-020). (4) If the social worker, probation officer, licensed adoption agency, adoption service provider, investigator, or petitioner knows or has reason to know or believe that an Indian child is or may be involved, that person or entity must make further inquiry as soon as practicable by: (A) Interviewing the parents, Indian custodian, and \"extended family members\" as defined in 25 United States Code section 1903, to gather the information listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.3(a)(5), Family Code section 180(b)(5), or Probate Code section 1460.2(b)(5); (B) Contacting the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the California Department of Social Services for assistance in identifying the names and contact information of the tribes in which the child may be a member or eligible for membership; and CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT 2025 (C) Contacting the tribes and any other person who reasonably can be expected to have information regarding the child's membership status or eligibility. These contacts must at a minimum include the contacts and sharing of information listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.2(e)(3). (5) The petitioner must on an ongoing basis include in its filings a detailed description of all inquiries, and further inquiries it has undertaken, and all information received pertaining to the child's Indian status, as well as evidence of how and when this information was provided to the relevant tribes. Whenever new information is received, that information must be expeditiously provided to the tribes. (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2013.) (b) Reason to know the child is an Indian child (1) There is reason to know a child involved in a proceeding is an Indian child if: (A) A person having an interest in the child, including the child, an officer of the court, a tribe, an Indian organization, a public or private agency, or a member of the child's extended family informs the court the child is an Indian child; (B) The residence or domicile of the child, the child's parents, or Indian custodian is on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village; (C) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court, Indian tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an Indian child; (D) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to know he or she is an Indian child; (E) The court is informed that the child is or has been a ward of a tribal court; or (F) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an identification card indicating membership or citizenship in an Indian tribe. (2) When there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, but the court does not have sufficient evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the court must confirm, by way of a report, declaration, or testimony included in the record that the agency or other party used due diligence to identify and work with all of the tribes of which there is reason to know the child may be a member, or eligible for membership, to verify whether the child is in fact a member or whether a biological parent is a member and the child is eligible for membership. Due diligence must include the further inquiry and tribal contacts discussed in (a)(4) above. (3) Upon review of the evidence of due diligence, further inquiry, and tribal contacts, if the court concludes that the agency or other party has fulfilled its duty of due diligence, further inquiry, and tribal contacts, the court may: (A) Find there is no reason to know the child is an Indian child and the Indian Child Welfare Act does not apply. Notwithstanding this determination, if the court or a party subsequently receives information that was not previously available relevant to the child's Indian status, the court must reconsider this finding; or (B) Find it is known the child is an Indian child, and that the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, and order compliance with the requirements of the act, including notice in accordance with (c) below; or (C) Find there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, order notice in accordance with (c) below, and treat the child as an Indian child unless and until the court determines on the record that the child is not an Indian child. (4) A determination by an Indian tribe that a child is or is not a member of, or eligible for membership in, that tribe, or testimony attesting to that status by a person authorized by the tribe to provide that determination, must be conclusive. Information that the child is not enrolled, or is not eligible for enrollment in, the tribe is not determinative of the child's membership status unless the tribe also confirms in writing that enrollment is a prerequisite for membership under tribal law or custom. (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2020.) (c) Notice (1) If it is known or there is reason to know an Indian child is involved in a proceeding listed in rule 5.480, except for a wardship proceeding under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 601 and 602 et seq., the social worker, petitioner, or in probate guardianship and conservatorship proceedings, if the petitioner is unrepresented, the court, must send Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child (form ICWA-030) to the parent or legal guardian and Indian custodian of an Indian child, and the Indian child's tribe, in the manner specified in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.3, Family Code section 180, and Probate Code section 1460.2 for all initial hearings that may result in the foster care placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement, or adoptive placement, or an order of guardianship, conservatorship, or custody under Family Code section 3041. For all other hearings, and for continued hearings, notice must be provided to the child's parents, legal guardian or Indian custodian, and tribe in accordance with Welfare and Institutions Code sections 292, 293, and 295. (2) If it is known or there is reason to know that an Indian child is involved in a wardship proceeding under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 601 and 602 et seq., the probation officer must send Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child (form ICWA-030) to the parent or legal guardian, Indian custodian, if any, and the child's tribe, in accordance with Welfare and Institutions Code section 727.4(a)(2) in any case described by rule 5.480(2)(A)-(C). (3) The circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an Indian child include the circumstances specified in (b)(1). (4) Notice to an Indian child's tribe must be sent to the tribal chairperson unless the tribe has designated another agent for service.

    "title": "Uniform bail and penalty schedules-traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, business licensing  The Judicial Council of California has established the policy of promulgating uniform bail and penalty schedules for certain offenses in order to achieve a standard of uniformity in the handling of these offenses. In general, bail is used to ensure the presence of the defendant before the court. Under Vehicle Code sections 40512 and 13103, bail may also be forfeited and forfeiture may be ordered without the necessity of any further court proceedings and be treated as a conviction for specified Vehicle Code offenses. A penalty in the form of a monetary sum is a fine imposed as all or a portion of a sentence imposed. To achieve substantial uniformity of bail and penalties throughout the state in traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing cases, the trial court judges, in performing their duty under Penal Code section 1269b to annually revise and adopt a schedule of bail and penalties for all misdemeanor and infraction offenses except Vehicle Code infractions, must give consideration to the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules approved by the Judicial Council. The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule for infraction violations of the Vehicle Code will be established by the Judicial Council in accordance with Vehicle Code section 40310. Judges must give consideration to requiring additional bail for aggravating or enhancing factors. After a court adopts a countywide bail and penalty schedule, under Penal Code section 1269b, the court must, as soon as practicable, mail or e-mail a copy of the schedule to the Judicial Council with a report stating how the revised schedule differs from the council's uniform traffic bail and penalty schedule, uniform boating bail and penalty schedule, uniform fish and game bail and penalty schedule, uniform forestry bail and penalty schedule, uniform public utilities bail and penalty schedule, uniform parks and recreation bail and penalty schedule, or uniform business licensing bail and penalty schedule. The purpose of this uniform bail and penalty schedule is to: (1) Show the standard amount for bail, which for Vehicle Code offenses may also be the amount used for a bail forfeiture instead of further proceedings; and (2) Serve as a guideline for the imposition of a fine as all or a portion of the penalty for a first conviction of a listed offense where a fine is used as all or a portion of the penalty for such offense. The amounts shown for the misdemeanors on the boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing bail and penalty schedules have been set with this dual purpose in mind. Unless otherwise shown, the maximum penalties for the listed offenses are six months in the county jail or a fine of $1,000, or both. The penalty amounts are intended to be used to provide standard fine amounts for a first offense conviction of a violation shown where a fine is used as all or a portion of the sentence imposed.  Note : Courts may obtain copies of the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules by contacting: Criminal Justice Services Judicial Council of California 455 Golden Gate Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102-3688 or Visit Criminal Justice Services to view most recent and past   Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules   under Additional Resources.

If the fees are not paid within the time specified in section 399(a), the court may, on a duly noticed motion by any party or on its own motion, dismiss the action without prejudice to the cause of action. Except as provided in (e), no other action on the cause may be commenced in another court before satisfaction of the court's order for fees and costs or a court-ordered waiver of such fees and costs. (2) If a transfer of jurisdiction is ordered by the court on its own motion, the court must specify in its order which party is responsible for the Government Code section 70618 fees.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a)(1) allows a party designating documents for inclusion in the clerk's transcript to specify portions of such documents that are not to be included, e.g., because they are duplicates of other designated documents or are not necessary for proper consideration of the issues raised in the appeal. The notice of designation should identify any portion to be omitted by means of a descriptive reference, e.g., by specific page or exhibit numbers. This provision is intended to simplify and therefore expedite the preparation of the clerk's transcript, to reduce its cost to the parties, and to relieve the courts of the burden of reviewing a record containing redundant, irrelevant, or immaterial documents. Subdivision (b). The supporting and opposing memoranda and attachments to any motion to vacate the judgment, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or for reconsideration of an appealed order are not required to be included in the clerk's transcript under subdivision (b)(1)(D) but may be included by designation of a party under (b)(3) or on motion of a party or the reviewing court under rule 8.155. Subdivision (b)(1)(F) requires the clerk's transcript to include the register of actions, if any. This provision is intended to assist the reviewing court in determining the accuracy of the clerk's transcript. Subdivision (c). Under subdivision (c)(2), a clerk who sends a notice under subdivision (c)(1) must include a certificate stating the date on which the clerk sent it. This provision is intended to establish the date when the 10-day period for depositing the cost of the clerk's transcript under this rule begins to run. The superior court will make the determination on any application to waive the fees for preparing, certifying, copying, and transmitting the clerk's transcript. Subdivision (d). The different timelines for preparing a clerk's transcript under subdivision (d)(2)(A) and (B) recognize that an appellant may apply for and receive a waiver of fees at different points during the appellate process. Some appellants may have applied for and obtained an order waiving fees before receiving the estimate of the cost of the clerk's transcript and thus may be able to provide that order to the court in lieu of making a deposit for the clerk's transcript. Other appellants may not apply for a waiver until after they receive the estimate of the cost for the clerk's transcript, in which case the time for preparing the transcript runs from the granting of that waiver. In cases in which a reporter's transcript has been designated, subdivision (d)(3) gives the clerk the option of waiting until the deposit for the reporter's transcript has been made before beginning preparation of the clerk's transcript.",

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). Under this provision either party may elect to have the appeal proceed by way of an appendix. If the appellant's fees for a clerk's transcript are not waived and the respondent timely elects to use an appendix, that election will govern unless the superior court orders otherwise. This election procedure differs from all other appellate rules governing designation of a record on appeal. In those rules, the appellant's designation, or the stipulation of the parties, determines the type of record on appeal. Before making this election, respondents should check whether the appellant has been granted a fee waiver that is still in effect. If the trial court has granted appellant a fee waiver for the clerk's transcript, or grants such a waiver after the notice of appeal is filed, respondent cannot elect to proceed by way of an appendix. Subdivision (a)(2) is intended to assist appellate counsel in preparing an appendix by providing them with the list of pleadings and other filings found in the register of actions or \"docket sheet\" in those counties that maintain such registers. (See Gov. Code, § 69845.) The provision is derived from rule 10-1 of the United States Circuit Rules (9th Cir.). Subdivision (b). Under subdivision (b)(1)(A), a joint appendix or an appellant's appendix must contain any register of actions that the clerk sent to the parties under subdivision (a)(2). This provision is intended to assist the reviewing court in determining the accuracy of the appendix. The provision is derived from rule 30-1.3(a)(ii) of the United States Circuit Rules (9th Cir.). In support of or opposition to pleadings or motions, the parties may have filed a number of lengthy documents in the proceedings in superior court, including, for example, declarations, memorandums, trial briefs, documentary exhibits (e.g., insurance policies, contracts, deeds), and photocopies of judicial opinions or other publications. Subdivision (b)(3)(A) prohibits the inclusion of such documents in an appendix when they are not necessary for proper consideration of the issues raised in the appeal. Even if a document is otherwise includable in an appendix, the rule prohibits the inclusion of any substantial portion of the document that is not necessary for proper consideration of the issues raised in the appeal. The prohibition is intended to simplify and therefore expedite the preparation of the appendix, to reduce its cost to the parties, and to relieve the courts of the burden of reviewing a record containing redundant, irrelevant, or immaterial documents. The provision is adapted from rule 30-1.4 of the United States Circuit Rules (9th Cir.). Subdivision (b)(3)(B) prohibits the inclusion in an appendix of transcripts of oral proceedings that may be made part of a reporter's transcript. (Compare rule 8.130(e)(3) [the reporter must not copy into the reporter's transcript any document includable in the clerk's transcript under rule 8.122].) The prohibition is intended to prevent a party filing an appendix from evading the requirements and safeguards imposed by rule 8.130 on the process of designating and preparing a reporter's transcript, or the requirements imposed by rule 8.144(e) on the use of daily or other transcripts instead of a reporter's transcript (i.e., renumbered pages, required indexes). In addition, if an appellant were to include in its appendix a transcript of less than all the proceedings, the respondent would not learn of any need to designate additional proceedings (under rule 8.130(a)(3)) until the appellant had served its appendix with its brief, when it would be too late to designate them. Note also that a party may file a certified transcript of designated proceedings instead of a deposit for the reporter's fee (rule 8.130(b)(3)). Subdivision (d). In current practice, served copies of filed documents often bear no clerk's date stamp and are not conformed by the parties serving them. Consistently with this practice, subdivision (d) does not require such documents to be conformed. The provision thereby relieves the parties of the burden of obtaining conformed copies at the cost of considerable time and expense and expedites the preparation of the appendix and the processing of the appeal. It is to be noted, however, that under subdivision (b)(1)(A) each document necessary to determine the timeliness of the appeal must show the date required under rule 8.104 or 8.108. Note also that subdivision (g) of rule 8.124 provides that a party filing an appendix represents under penalty of sanctions that its copies of documents are accurate. Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e)(2) requires a joint appendix to be filed with the appellant's opening brief or before the filing of the appellant's opening brief. The provision is intended to improve the briefing process by enabling the appellant's opening brief to include citations to the record and, by allowing earlier filing of the appendix, to assist courts in considering petitions for supersedeas. To provide for the case in which a respondent concludes in light of the appellant's opening brief that the joint appendix should have included additional documents, subdivision (b)(5) permits such a respondent to present in an appendix filed with its respondent's brief (see subd. (e)(3)) any document that could have been included in the joint appendix. Under subdivision (e)(2)-(4) an appendix is required to be filed, at the latest, \"with\" the associated brief. This provision is intended to clarify that an extension of a briefing period ipso facto extends the filing period of an appendix associated with the brief. Subdivision (g). Under subdivision (g), sanctions do not depend on the degree of culpability of the filing party-i.e., on whether the party's conduct was willful or negligent-but on the nature of the inaccuracies and the importance of the documents they affect.",

The notice must identify any proceeding for which a certified transcript has previously been prepared by checking the appropriate box on   Appellant's Notice Designating Record on Appeal (Unlimited Civil)   (form APP-003) or, if that form is not used, placing an asterisk before that proceeding in the notice. (2) If the appellant designates less than all the testimony, the notice must state the points to be raised on appeal; the appeal is then limited to those points unless, on motion, the reviewing court permits otherwise. (3) If the appellant serves and files a notice designating a reporter's transcript, the respondent may, within 10 days after such service, serve and file a notice in superior court designating any additional proceedings the respondent wants included in the transcript. The notice must identify any proceeding for which a certified transcript has previously been prepared by checking the appropriate box on   Respondent's Notice Designating Record on Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case)   (form APP-010) or, if that form is not used, placing an asterisk before that proceeding in the notice. (4) If the appellant elects to proceed without a reporter's transcript, the respondent cannot require that a reporter's transcript be prepared. But the reviewing court, on its own or the respondent's motion, may order the record augmented under rule 8.155 to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

(b) Deposit or substitute for cost of transcript  (1) With its notice of designation, a party must deposit with the superior court clerk the approximate cost of transcribing the proceedings it designates and a fee of $50 for the superior court to hold this deposit in trust. The deposit must be either: (A) The amount specified in the reporter's written estimate; or (B) An amount calculated as follows: (i) For proceedings that have not previously been transcribed: $325 per fraction of the day's proceedings that did not exceed three hours, or $650 per day or fraction that exceeded three hours. (ii) For proceedings that have previously been transcribed: $80 per fraction of the day's proceedings that did not exceed three hours, or $160 per day or fraction that exceeded three hours. (2) If the reporter believes the deposit is inadequate, within 15 days after the clerk sends the notice under (d)(1) the reporter may file with the clerk and send to the designating party an estimate of the transcript's total cost at the statutory rate, showing the additional deposit required. The party must deposit the additional sum within 10 days after the reporter sends the estimate. (3) Instead of a deposit under (1), the party may substitute: (A) The reporter's written waiver of a deposit. A reporter may waive the deposit for a part of the designated proceedings, but such a waiver replaces the deposit for only that part.

The reporter must also file one copy of the original transcript, or more than one copy if multiple appellants equally share the cost of preparing the record (see rule 8.147(a)(2)). Only the reviewing court can extend the time to prepare the reporter's transcript (see rule 8.60). (2) When the transcript is completed, the reporter must notify all parties to the appeal that the transcript is complete, bill each designating party at the statutory rate, and send a copy of the bill to the superior court clerk. The clerk must pay the reporter from that party's deposited funds and refund any excess deposit or notify the party of any additional funds needed. In a multiple reporter case, the clerk must pay each reporter who certifies under penalty of perjury that his or her transcript portion is completed. (3) If the appeal is abandoned or is dismissed before the reporter has filed the transcript, the reporter must inform the superior court clerk of the cost of the portion of the transcript that the reporter has completed. The clerk must pay that amount to the reporter from the appellant's deposited funds and refund any excess deposit. (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, July 1, 2008, January 1, 2014, January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2017.) (g) Disputes over transcript costs Notwithstanding any dispute that may arise over the estimated or billed costs of a reporter's transcript, a designating party must timely comply with the requirements under this rule regarding deposits for transcripts. If a designating party believes that a reporter's estimate or bill is excessive, the designating party may file a complaint with the Court Reporters Board. (Subd (g) adopted effective January 1, 2014.) (h) Agreed or settled statement when proceedings cannot be transcribed (1) If any portion of the designated proceedings cannot be transcribed, the superior court clerk must so notify the designating party in writing; the notice must show the date it was sent. The party may then substitute an agreed or settled statement for that portion of the designated proceedings by complying with either (A) or (B): (A) Within 10 days after the notice is sent, the party may file in superior court, under rule 8.134, an agreed statement or a stipulation that the parties are attempting to agree on a statement. If the party files a stipulation, within 30 days thereafter the party must file the agreed statement, move to use a settled statement under rule 8.137, or proceed without such a statement; or (B) Within 10 days after the notice is sent, the party may move in superior court to use a settled statement. If the court grants the motion, the statement must be served, filed, and settled as rule 8.137 provides, but the order granting the motion must fix the times for doing so. (2) If the agreed or settled statement contains all the oral proceedings, it will substitute for the reporter's transcript; if it contains a portion of the proceedings, it will be incorporated into that transcript. (3) This remedy supplements any other available remedies.

Advisory Committee Comment Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a)(1) requires that every notice designating a reporter's transcript identify which proceedings are to be included, and that it do so by specifying the date or dates on which those proceedings took place. Those proceedings for which a certified transcript has previously been prepared must be identified in the party's designation. If the appellant does not want a portion of the proceedings on a given date to be included, the notice should identify that portion by means of a descriptive reference (e.g., \"August 3, 2004, but not the proceedings on defendant's motion to tax costs\"). As used in subdivision (a)(1), the phrase \"proceedings\" includes all instructions that the court gives, whether or not submitted in writing, and any instructions that counsel orally propose but the court refuses; all such instructions are included in the reporter's transcript if designated under this rule. All instructions that counsel submit in writing, whether or not given to the jury, are lodged with the superior court clerk and are included in the clerk's transcript if designated under rule 8.122. Under subdivision (a), portions of depositions read in open court but not reported, or not read but lodged with the superior court clerk, are included in the clerk's transcript if designated under rule 8.122. Subdivision (b). Where a certified transcript has been previously prepared, subdivision (b) makes clear that the certified transcript may be filed in lieu of a deposit for the transcript only where the certified transcript contains all of the proceedings identified in the notice of designation and the transcript complies with the format requirements of rule 8.144 (e.g., cover information, renumbered pages, required indexes). Parties using this alternative to a deposit are responsible for ensuring that such transcripts are in the proper format. Parties may arrange with a court reporter to do the necessary formatting of the transcript or may do the formatting themselves. Otherwise, where a certified transcript has been previously prepared for only some of the designated proceedings, subdivision (b)(1) authorizes a reduced fee to be deposited for those proceedings. This reduced deposit amount was established in recognition of the holding in Hendrix v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 889 that the statutory rate for an original transcript only applies to the first transcription of the reporter's notes. The amount of the deposit is based on the rate established by Government Code section 69950(b) for a first copy of a reporter's transcript purchased by any court, party, or other person who does not simultaneously purchase the original. To eliminate any ambiguity, subdivision (b)(3) recognizes, first, that a party may substitute a court reporter's written waiver of a deposit for part of the designated proceedings and, second, that in such event the waiver replaces the deposit for only that part. Subdivision (b) and subdivision (f) refer to the \"statutory rate\" for reporter's transcripts. The fees for reporter's transcripts are established by Government Code sections 69950 and 69554. Subdivision (c). Under subdivision (c), an application to the Court Reporters Board for payment or reimbursement of the cost of the reporter's transcript from the Transcript Reimbursement Fund (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 8030.8) is a permissible substitute for the required deposit of the reporter's fee (subd. (b)(3)) and thereby prevents issuance of a notice of default (subd. (d)(5)). Business and Professions Code sections 8030.6 and 8030.8 use the term \"reimbursement\" to mean not only a true reimbursement, i.e., repaying a party who has previously paid the reporter out of the party's own funds (see id ., § 8030.8, subd. (d)), but also a direct payment to a reporter who has not been previously paid by the party (see id., § 8030.6, subds. (b) and (d)). Subdivision (f) recognizes this special dual meaning by consistently using the compound phrase \"payment or reimbursement.\" Subdivision (d). Under subdivision (d)(2), the clerk's notice to the reporter must show the date on which the clerk sent the notice. This provision is intended to establish the date when the period for preparing the reporter's transcript under subdivision (f)(1) begins to run. Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e)(1) clarifies that: (1) when a certified transcript containing all of the proceedings identified in the notice of designation is submitted in lieu of a deposit, the court reporter will not prepare a reporter's transcript; and (2) that the court reporter will only transcribe those proceedings that have not previously been transcribed and will include a copy of those proceedings that have previously been transcribed in the reporter's transcript. Under rule 8.144, the full transcript, including the previously transcribed material, must meet the format requirements for a reporter's transcript. Subdivision (e)(3) is not intended to relieve the reporter of the duty to report all oral proceedings, including the reading of instructions or other documents. Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f)(1) requires the reporter to prepare and file additional copies of the record \"if multiple appellants equally share the cost of preparing the record. . . .\" The reason for the requirement is explained in the comment to rule 8.147(a)(2).",

(d) Contents of proposed statement The proposed statement must: (1) Contain a statement of the points the appellant is raising on appeal. If the condensed narrative under (2) covers only a portion of the oral proceedings, the appeal is then limited to the points identified in the statement unless the reviewing court determines that the record permits the full consideration of another point or, on motion, the reviewing court permits otherwise. (2) Contain a condensed narrative of the oral proceedings that the appellant specified under (b)(3). (A) The condensed narrative must include a concise factual summary of the evidence and the testimony of each witness relevant to the points that the appellant states under (1) are being raised on appeal. Subject to the court's approval in settling the statement, the appellant may present some or all of the evidence by question and answer. Any evidence or portion of a proceeding not included will be presumed to support the judgment or order appealed from. (B) If one of the points that the appellant states will be raised on appeal is a challenge to the giving, refusal, or modification of a jury instruction, the condensed narrative must include any instructions submitted orally and not in writing and must identify the party that requested the instruction and any modification. (3) Have attached to it a copy of the judgment or order being appealed. (Subd (d) adopted effective January 1, 2018.)

(Subd (e) adopted effective January 1, 2018.) (f) Review of appellant's proposed statement (1) No later than 10 days after the respondent files proposed amendments or the time to do so expires, whichever is earlier, a party may request a hearing to review and correct the proposed statement. No hearing will be held unless ordered by the trial court judge, and the judge will not ordinarily order a hearing unless there is a factual dispute about a material aspect of the trial court proceedings. (2) The trial court judge may order that a transcript be prepared as the record of the oral proceedings instead of correcting a proposed statement on appeal if the trial court proceedings were reported by a court reporter, the trial court judge determines that doing so would save court time and resources, and the court has a local rule permitting such an order. The court will pay for any transcript ordered under this subdivision. (3) Except as provided in (2), if no hearing is ordered, no later than 10 days after the time for requesting a hearing expires, the trial court judge must review the proposed statement and any proposed amendments filed by the respondent and take one of the following actions: (A) If the proposed statement does not contain material required under (d), the trial court judge may order the appellant to prepare a new proposed statement. The order must identify the additional material that must be included in the statement to comply with (d) and the date by which the new proposed statement must be served and filed. If the appellant does not serve and file a new proposed statement as directed, the appellant will be deemed to be in default, and rule 8.140 will apply. (B) If the trial court judge does not issue an order under (A), the judge must either: (i) Make any corrections or modifications to the statement necessary to ensure that it is an accurate summary of the evidence and the testimony of each witness relevant to the points that the appellant states under (d) (1) are being raised on appeal; or (ii) Identify the necessary corrections and modifications, and order the appellant to prepare a statement incorporating these corrections and modifications. (4) If a hearing is ordered, the court must promptly set the hearing date and provide the parties with at least 5 days' written notice of the hearing date. No later than 10 days after the hearing, the trial court judge must either: (A) Make any corrections or modifications to the statement necessary to ensure that it is an accurate summary of the evidence and the testimony of each witness relevant to the points that the appellant states under (d)(1) are being raised on appeal; or (B) Identify the necessary corrections and modifications and order the appellant to prepare a statement incorporating these corrections and modifications. (5) The trial court judge must not eliminate the appellant's specification of grounds of appeal from the proposed statement. (Subd (f) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2018; adopted as subd (c).) (g) Review of the corrected statement (1) If the trial court judge makes any corrections or modifications to the proposed statement under (f), the clerk must serve copies of the corrected or modified statement on the parties. If under (f) the trial court judge orders the appellant to prepare a statement incorporating corrections and modifications, the appellant must serve and file the corrected or modified statement within the time ordered by the court. If the appellant does not serve and file a corrected or modified statement as directed, the appellant will be deemed to be in default and rule 8.140 will apply. (2) Within 10 days after the corrected or modified statement is served on the parties, any party may serve and file proposed modifications or objections to the statement. (3) Within 10 days after the time for filing proposed modifications or objections under (2) has expired, the trial court judge must review the corrected or modified statement and any proposed modifications or objections to the statement filed by the parties. The procedures in (f)(2) or (f)(3) apply if the trial court judge determines that further corrections or modifications are necessary to ensure that the statement is an accurate summary of the evidence and the testimony of each witness relevant to the points that the appellant states under (d)(1) are being raised on appeal. (Subd (g) amended effective April 1, 2023; adopted effective January 1, 2018.) (h) Certification of the statement on appeal (1) If the trial court judge does not order the preparation of a transcript under (f)(2) in lieu of correcting the proposed statement or order any corrections or modifications to the proposed statement under (f)(3), (f)(4), or (g)(3), the judge must promptly certify the statement. (2) The parties may serve and file a stipulation that the statement as originally served under (c) or as corrected or modified under (f)(3), (f)(4), or (g)(3) is correct. Such a stipulation is equivalent to the judge's certification of the statement. (3) Upon certification of the statement under (1) or receipt of a stipulation under (2), the certified statement must immediately be transmitted to the clerk for filing of the record under rule 8.150.

Advisory Committee Comment This rule summarizes the questions that the court is required to consider at the time of sentencing, in their logical order. Subdivision (a)(2) makes it clear that probation should be considered in every case, without the necessity of any application, unless the defendant is statutorily ineligible for probation. Under subdivision (b), when imposition of sentence is to be suspended, the sentencing judge is not to make any determinations as to possible length of a term of imprisonment on violation of probation (section 1170(b)). If there was a trial, however, the judge must state on the record the circumstances that would justify imposition of one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment based on the trial evidence. Subdivision (d) makes it clear that all sentencing matters should be disposed of at a single hearing unless strong reasons exist for a continuance.",
