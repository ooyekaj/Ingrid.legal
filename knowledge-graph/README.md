# Unified Knowledge Graph System

A comprehensive system that connects California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP), California Rules of Court (CRC), and county-specific rules to provide unified filing requirement answers.

## Overview

This system solves the problem of fragmented legal information by creating a unified knowledge graph that can answer complex queries like:

> "What are the filing requirements for a motion for summary judgment in Santa Clara County for Judge Charles F. Adams in complex civil litigation?"

## Features

### üîó **Unified Knowledge Graph**
- Connects CCP statutes, CRC rules, and county-specific procedures
- Creates cross-references between related rules across different jurisdictions
- Maintains hierarchical relationships: State ‚Üí Court ‚Üí County ‚Üí Judge

### üéØ **Smart Query Processing**
- Natural language query parsing
- Automatic extraction of jurisdiction, case type, judge, and motion details
- Contextual rule matching based on query components

### üìä **Multiple Output Formats**
- **Cytoscape**: Interactive graph visualization
- **D3**: Web-based graph rendering
- **GraphML**: Standard graph exchange format
- **JSON**: Structured data for applications

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Comprehensive Answers**
- Applicable rules from all relevant jurisdictions
- Procedural step-by-step instructions
- Key deadlines and filing requirements
- Local variations and judge-specific procedures

## Installation

```bash
cd knowledge-graph
npm install
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Demo

```bash
npm run demo
```

This will:
- Load existing CCP, CRC, and county knowledge graphs
- Create a unified graph with cross-system connections
- Demonstrate various filing requirement queries
- Generate a comprehensive filing guide

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Verifies all system components work correctly.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Query

```javascript
const UnifiedKnowledgeGraphGenerator = require('./unified_knowledge_graph_generator');

const generator = new UnifiedKnowledgeGraphGenerator();

// Generate unified graph
const unifiedGraph = await generator.generateUnifiedGraph(
  './ccp_knowledge_graph/ccp_knowledge_graph_cytoscape.json',
  './crc-scraper/crc_results/knowledge_graph/crc_knowledge_graph_cytoscape.json.gz',
  './county-rules-scraper/results/knowledge_graphs'
);

// Answer a query
const answer = await generator.answerFilingQuery(
  "California, Santa Clara County, Complex Civil Litigation, Judge Charles F. Adams, Motion for summary judgment"
);

console.log(answer);
```
